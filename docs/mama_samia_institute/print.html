<p>A beautiful value based Incubator concept with the purpose of helping Tanzania bring sustainable digital economic growth in harmony with nature, local population and government requirements. </p>
<p>The Digitization of Tanzania is inevitable, we have a chance to make it a home grown digitization that considers the values, culture and actual needs of Tanzania rather than importing solutions that are often dependent on external parties that forces the assimilation of Tanzania to foreign requirements. The home grown digitization will unlock the potential of the Tanzanian economy. </p>
<p>We have a unique chance to use digital technology to advance a country's future with full sovereignty and independence.</p>
<p>Young people need actionable hope in the current global climate, it's often hard for them and their future often looks grim. Our future generations need hope and a practical way forward. The Mama Samia Institute wants to be the home for thousands of young people, helping them to create their own regenerative future which can have an impact on millions of people globally. </p>
<p>We do this by using advanced but sustainable technology concepts as well as a value based approach. We are not talkers, we are doers.</p>

<p>The African Union has defined four steps to achieve a digital society for all Africans. </p>
<h2 id="bridging-the-digital-divide"><a class="header" href="#bridging-the-digital-divide">Bridging the Digital Divide</a></h2>
<p>A critical first step which stresses the importance of access to digital infrastructure. Mama Samia Institute will have the technology and know-how needed to deploy digital infrastructure throughout Tanzania.</p>
<h2 id="invest-in-digital-inclusion-and-skills"><a class="header" href="#invest-in-digital-inclusion-and-skills">Invest in Digital inclusion and Skills</a></h2>
<p>Mama Samia institute will host technology and startups that will focus on upskilling the digital capability and skills of Tanzanians through education, awareness and utilizing existing AU programs such as the &quot; Online Digital Skills for All Programme&quot;. </p>

<p><img src="mama_samia_institute/img/for_humanity_planet.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>The world has become a harsh place. Climate change is real. Economic systems seem to be on the verge of collapse. Many young people are losing hope. Everything seems to be based on survival of the fittest, still today we are all together wasting mother earth’s resources in favor of personal gain. This can and needs to change.</p>
<p>We believe emerging countries have an important role to play, they might have the will and power to leapfrog into a powerful digital ecosystem future. Many &quot;so called&quot; developed regions are stuck in the creations of their past. Their effort goes into trying not to lose what they have achieved. We believe this will not work. We need change, and change needs to happen now. This is for the future of our children. </p>
<p>We made mother earth sick. Let's empower our youth, let's say no to the constant brainwashing of the current internet and media systems. Our young friends need to be free in their mind, non manipulated, to be able to make decisions based on hope, respect and love, not based on fear. </p>
<p>Technology could be a solution but often these projects have been created to the benefit of the founders and their investors rather than the planet (look at most blockchain projects, which might have started with good intentions but many of them are no more than cleverly masked pyramid schemes making a few people rich). </p>
<p>Who are we to write these heavy words? Our team is here to make a difference, we have serious experience and want to put everything to work what we have achieved over the last 30 years to the benefit of the future generations, we choose to be at the service of emerging countries who mean well. We have the will, experience and drive to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>We believe that youth and specifically women can be the driver of much needed change where respect for nature and the endorsement of country communities will prevail.</strong></p>

<p>Mama Samia Institute researches and develops required Independance and Sustainability Policies (ISP’s) for the multiple projects as required by the government of TNZ and ZNZ. </p>
<h3 id="independance-and-sustainability-policies-are-based-around-the-following-principles"><a class="header" href="#independance-and-sustainability-policies-are-based-around-the-following-principles">Independance and Sustainability Policies are based around the following principles:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As much as possible, Tanzania companies (with majority shareholding from Tanzania investors) and/or Mama Samia Institute are getting unlimited access to all required Intellectual Property (e.g. sourcecode in case of digital technology, or documents in case of other technology). Vendors who are not willing to open up their knowledge cannot deliver their projects to our country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break down each project to having to use most of the components that can be sourced from within the country, or from outside but then from multiple sources (India, China, Europe, US, etc.), and directly from the manufacturer of the components. This resolves longevity, independence, and reduced pricing, for the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together with the eventual partner (if needed), to create local knowledge centers where the solutions can be recreated from the components as mentioned above without help from outside. The funding for such  local centers need to come from project financing and the business case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a large enough stock of replacement components as part of each project to make sure that continuation can be maintained if the global supply chain has hiccups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask for the most simple solutions which are just good enough for the requirements which are respectful of the country resources and its people. Often things can be done in a much more simple way as vendors would like us to believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All products or services delivered need to be operated from TNZ/ZNZ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No data can leave the country, all applications need to be hosted inside TNZ/ZNZ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No product can have backdoors allowing others access into systems as deployed in the country.
In case backdoors cannot be removed, sufficient protection mechanisms need to be created to try and mitigate the issues. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not sell out natural resources of TNZ and ZNZ, it's too easy right now for companies and people from outside to leverage the natural resources and divert the profits made from it outside the country. Resources from TNZ and ZNZ belong to people living in TNZ and ZNZ, as such these resources need to be protected and valued in the right way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="some-examples-of-where-we-know-it-can-be-done"><a class="header" href="#some-examples-of-where-we-know-it-can-be-done">Some examples of where we know it can be done</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Telecom infrastructure (4G/5G), eventually even with local manufacturing</li>
<li>Internet Infrastructure and most of its components</li>
<li>Electric vehicles (batteries, simple cars and bicycles, …)</li>
<li>Education systems and its required knowledge base</li>
<li>Regenerative farming practices (organic fertilizers, data driven farming cycles, required machinery…) and its tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-can-this-be-done"><a class="header" href="#how-can-this-be-done">How can this be done?</a></h3>
<p>We will build amazing locations in TNZ/ZNZ where top talent = high quality engineers, coders and technologists and their families will want to reside. These top talents will get free housing, 100% tax exemption for the time they work to deliver on the promise of ISP and most importantly a margin share in the success of the ISP project(s).</p>
<p>The Mama Samia Institute can be used as a validating point for the implementation of this approach, our aim is to also facilitate startups which can practically work on delivering some of the solutions 100% from within the country.</p>
<h3 id="reality-check"><a class="header" href="#reality-check">Reality check</a></h3>
<p>This ambitious goal will not be achieved in one year, it will require time to materialize and a shift in mentality where many in the country believe we have to rely on resources from outside and we don’t have enough belief in our own capabilities and value in relation to a global world.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Foundations without shareholders are a practical way how land or mines can be owned without handing over control and too much of the profit to external shareholders. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology can resolve a lot. Practical satellite technology, blockchain and DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) mechanisms can be used to make sure that there is a fair contribution in the country. </p>

<li>
<p>Rather than using debt based instruments, shariah compliant investment mechanisms are more safe to protect the wealth of TNZ and ZNZ.</p>

<h2 id="threefold"><a class="header" href="#threefold">ThreeFold</a></h2>
<p>50m USD has been spent to create technology for a new internet, all has been done, the roll out is happening. We are willing to donate 20% of the shares of Threefold to Mama Samia Institute.</p>
<p>We are looking for ways to move the HQ from ThreeFold to ZNZ or TNZ.</p>
<p>ThreeFold will be valued +500m USD in the near future, and billions not much later, let's use this opportunity to make healthy PR for Tanzania and Zanzibar as a possible safe technology hub.</p>
<p>We can deliver a full blown internet experience for less than 1 USD per person per month.</p>
<p>ThreeFold would be 25% owned by MSI, initial investment from MSI = 5m USD for 5%, the other 20% has been donated by Kristof to the Mama Samia Institute.</p>
<h2 id="ourledger"><a class="header" href="#ourledger">OurLedger</a></h2>
<p>Tanzania or Zanzibar does not need an American or Chinese blockchain as the base for its future digital currencies or for other blockchain requirements. We suggest to create a new company at least 51% owned by MSI which will deliver blockchain technology to TNZ, ZNZ and around. The technology delivered will be truly fully decentralized, with blockchain nodes in the region and with no backdoors. The sourcecode will be available and a lot of attention will go to make sure that the countries who use this blockchain technology have met their requirements without losing their sovereignity. This blockchain can be used for digital currencies even for a Central Bank Powered Currency, digital identity, land ownership, etc. All knowledge and technology will be available in the country.</p>
<p>Incubaid and Threefold will provide all required knowledge and technology.</p>
<p>OurVerse would be 51% owned by MSI, initial investment from MSI = 2m USD.</p>
<h2 id="ourverse"><a class="header" href="#ourverse">OurVerse</a></h2>
<p>We would like to move our project OurVerse to ZNZ or TNZ. Ourverse owns an amazing metaverse technology. This technology can be used for augmented reality, education, virtual meetings, virtual health care, virtual shopping malls, etc. Possibilities of modern metaverse technology are endless.</p>
<p>OurVerse would be 20% owned by MSI, initial investment from MSI = 2m USD.</p>
<h2 id="omnisphere"><a class="header" href="#omnisphere">OmniSphere</a></h2>
<p>The CyberPandemic is a reality, we have developed a real antidote for this problem. Security is becoming a major concern for governments.  OmniSphere's purpose is to commercialize solutions based on ThreeFold and some other based on Incubaid startups technology for helping governments, banks and enterprises, to beat this CyberPandmic Virus with a real antidote.</p>
<p>We would like to move our project OmniSphere to ZNZ or TNZ.</p>
<p>OmniSphere would be 33% owned by MSI, initial investment from MSI = 5m USD. ThreeFold would own another 33%, another investor 20% and the team the remaining 14%. </p>
<h2 id="ourland"><a class="header" href="#ourland">OurLand</a></h2>
<p>Ourland uses ThreeFold, OurLedger, OmniSphere and OurVerse to create an alternative to google maps, but way more powerful. This platform allows virtual and augmented reality access to a Virtual Reality enabled platform which has digitized all relevant data for TNZ and ZNZ.</p>
<p>Some capabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Land Registry (2D and 3D, augmented and virtual reality, blockchain enabled)</li>
<li>Country wide e-commerce marketplace (allow everyone to trade with each other)</li>
<li>Alternative to Uber, Deliveroo, AirBNB, Expedia, etc.</li>
<li>Virtual tourism (allow users to explore before actually coming to TNZ/ZNZ)</li>
<li>Real time farming data </li>
<li>Augmented reality powered infrastructure management </li>
</ul>
<p>OurLand would be 51% owned by MSI, initial investment from MSI = 5m USD.</p>
<h2 id="ourport"><a class="header" href="#ourport">OurPort</a></h2>
<p>Ourport uses ThreeFold, OurLedger, OmniSphere and OurVerse to create a solution to manage ports in the most automated way, and to lower the loss of revenues of the country. </p>
<p>Some capabilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Ledger (blockchain) based information flow</li>
<li>Augmented reality for investigating containers &amp; shipping protocol</li>
<li>Advanced information system open to and integrated with external transport systems</li>
<li>All hosted on sovereign ultra reliable internet platform as provided by ThreeFold</li>
</ul>
<p>OurLand would be 80% owned by MSI, 20% by team, initial investment from MSI = 4m USD. We will look for further funding.</p>
<h2 id="sikana"><a class="header" href="#sikana">Sikana</a></h2>
<p>A online video education platform with 4 billion views, we would like to futher develop it and make it crowdfunded to allow education to the African continent. </p>

<h2 id="other-projects"><a class="header" href="#other-projects">Other Projects</a></h2>
<p>There are many more projects to create and relocate, but above gives us an idea of what is possible and how value can be created right away.</p>

<p><img src="mama_samia_institute/img/header.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>The Internet is one of mankind’s greatest achievements. More than ever, it is playing a crucial role in our evolution to the point that internet access has become a human right. However, still today more than 3 billion people have no access to the internet, especially in developing countries. That is because the current internet infrastructure consists of hyper-scale data centers that are extremely costly and hard to deploy.</p>
<p>Still, over 1 billion people and 70 billion devices are expected to join the digital economy by 2025. Digital inclusion as well as the emergence of Edge Computing, Blockchain, Big Data and the Internet of Things requires Internet capacity to expand well beyond its current limitations.</p>
<p>Today, there are only two options available: to build power-hungry, hyper-scale data centers that cost billions (if not trillion) of dollars and require expert maintenance and sales teams; or to give up on data ownership and outsource infrastructure requirements to the tech giants that already own the majority of all Internet infrastructure and networks today.</p>
<p>Net neutrality is at stake and humanity deserves a better alternative than a centralized and unsustainable system benefiting a handful of companies that turn people into products.</p>
<p>Powered by our open source technology, we have created an open, autonomous and regenerative Internet infrastructure that can scale limitlessly. It flips the current centralized model upside down, and allows anyone to join the world’s largest and fastest growing economy in the world - the Internet and cloud economy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="some-100-owned-startups"><a class="header" href="#some-100-owned-startups">Some 100% owned startups</a></h2>
<p>We would like to create some startups which are 100% owned by MSI and as such generate profit for MSI.</p>
<p>Two examples who will require some more explanation</p>
<ul>
<li>CBDC = Central Bank Digital Currency for TNZ/ZNZ</li>
<li>Gold (maybe Tanzanite or other materials) Token based financing and mining</li>
<li>Carbon credit farming &amp; exchange platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Example about the carbon credit farming projects: it is very beneficial for Tanzania as well as to the investors who might want to invest in such a startup. These carbon credits would be digitized by blockchain technology as provided by ThreeFold and the Mama Samia Institute. We want to fundraise money for a carbon farming startup in Tanzania with massive ICV (In Country Value), Protecting land and farming carbon credits are a possibility today providing good for everyone involved. For this project, we work with Take Action Global who will be an integral part of our Institute, see <a href="https://www.takeactionglobal.org/">https://www.takeactionglobal.org/</a>. They have very concrete and well working programs to enable youth through education to deliver on the promise of climate change and provide concrete benefits for them and their families.</p>

<h2 id="direct-investors-in-mama-samia-institute"><a class="header" href="#direct-investors-in-mama-samia-institute">Direct Investors in Mama Samia Institute</a></h2>
<p>Together we fundraise 50m USD in Mama Samia Institute. We give out 20% of the shares of MSI to investors.</p>
<p>The investors get following benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferential co-investment rights, they can invest upto 10x their investment into startups coming out of MSI. Example if an investor invests 2m USD in MSI, they can invest 20m USD in the startups coming out of MSI. The startups from MSI give absolute preferential rights to these investors</li>
<li>Investors in the startups of the MSI always get liquidation preference on their investments, which means in case a startup has a less big exit as expected, they get their money back first</li>
<li>Investors get Tax exemption on capital gains on their investment in the Institute as well as in the startups of the Institute (using their co-investment rights)</li>
<li>Investors get preferential right to commercialize the products and services as offered by these startups</li>
<li>They can leverage the knowledge and research capabilities of MSI for their own companies without having to pay for it. All knowledge is available to them. Regular training sessions will be organized which are available for employees of the investor</li>
<li>They get a return on their investment as the Institute grows, the shares will be made liquid by means of a regulated Security Token Offering.</li>
</ul>
<p>This 50m USD will be a required first step to get us going.</p>
<h2 id="grants"><a class="header" href="#grants">Grants</a></h2>
<p>MSI will create a department of talented people who know how to apply for grants and get money in a safe (not debt based) way without sacrificing any of our policies as defined in NWCP and ISP.</p>
<p>We expect to be able to mobilize +50m USD of grants per year within a couple of years.</p>
<h2 id="sponsoring-from-partners"><a class="header" href="#sponsoring-from-partners">Sponsoring from partners.</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The institute is looking for sponsors</li>
<li>The institute grows knowledge and opportunities for its ecosystem</li>
<li>The institute will provide valuable knowledge to every company or organization in Tanzania and around</li>
<li>The institute would be very happy to share this knowledge to any sponsor free of charge</li>
<li>One of the key question the institute tries to answer is how can organizations be more effective with collaboration, IT systems, security, cloud and tools. Being effective in a highly dynamic environment is important, this is super valuable information which can benefit all participants</li>
<li>This information will be free of charge and training sessions / seminars will be created to allow the Samia Institute Sponsors to create value for their own communities</li>
<li>The help from the sponsors is highly appreciated and will also be mentioned on the website of the institute</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exits"><a class="header" href="#exits">Exits</a></h2>
<p>The institute will get meaningful exits which means serious cash will come because of exits. Kristof and Incubaid are willing to donate shares of their startups to MSI which might be worth hundreds of millions within 5 years.</p>
<p>New startups will also generate exits and liquidity, these proceeds can be used to further grow the Institute.</p>
<p>Next to the financial gain, these exits will be PR wise very important for our country.</p>

<p>Our team launched the internet hosting and datacenter business in Europe. It's fair to say that we were at the beginning of the internet's enormous growth at that time. We hosted the largest websites in the world during this period. UEFA, Nasa, World Cup.Numerous times we demonstrated how to achieve super scale while staying sustainable.</p>

<p>Upto 100x benefit compared to the status quo in data centers at that point.
We showed how our customers could back up full data centers with 100x less energy and storage utilization.</p>
<p>This product still lives on in all Symantec backup products. This was a highly innovative solution, there was nothing like it at the time as. It facilitated the  move away from tape to disk based backup systems.</p>

<p>We formed one of the key innovation groups in the field of cloud computing. Concepts like Virtual Private Datacenter were invented by us. We were one of the main sources of inspiration for companies like VMWare for their cloud strategy. We became the core of SUN microsystem, and the inspiration behind Sun’s ambition to become the largest player in the cloud industry. This didn’t happen in the end because Oracle bought SUN and buried all Sun’s cloud computing projects.</p>

<p>This was a major technological achievement, we pioneered and developed the method to store data in a database over multiple sites in such a way that data could never be lost, corrupted or order of updates changed. Consistency was key. This database was called Arakoon and served as inspiration for further database projects. This fact is little known but is especially relevant today.</p>

<p>We invented a way to store petabytes of information in such a way that no-one can hack it, and the data can never be corrupted.</p>
<p>This system was 10x more energy efficient compared to any alternative. This led to our biggest exit to date. Even today there are barely any storage systems which can compete with our approach and solutions that were developed at that time.</p>

<p>The benefits of this system are huge. We had to write an operating system from scratch (re-using linux kernel), a new blockchain provisioning layer as well as the most reliable and sustainable storage system in the world. This system has now been deployed in many locations. More than 40m USD has been invested by founders and friends to make this possible.</p>

<p>We believe the planet is a beautiful place, we believe the super large majority of people do mean well. But many of us live in fear and that holds us back. Basic needs are often not covered, this will remain challenging but providing regenerative tools might help.</p>
<p>The internet and new technologies can be an incredible tool to bring wealth to large amounts of people but today this is not the case. Very few (internet companies) have the benefit of us all. </p>
<p>The internet used to be an incredible invention and place, we lost this, we want to help restore the internet to its original glory and deliver it as a tool for humanity to create on.</p>
<p>Our personal passion is to deliver a system which allows us all to co-create our future and work together rather than having to compete and fight for survival. We had incredible mentors who showed us some of the pieces required for which we are very grateful.</p>
<p>We believe the world needs more female energy and through youth and women empowerment big change can be achieved in a more sustainable way.</p>
<p>We spend all our time trying to help where we can and let this vision come alive.</p>
<p>We personally feel more at home in emerging countries compared to the more developed regions, there seems to be more possibility for creation and often people more easily find the path to their hearts. Real emotions are what drives us all.</p>
<h1 id="the-link-to-tanzania"><a class="header" href="#the-link-to-tanzania">The Link To Tanzania</a></h1>
<p>We as founders are looking for a place where we can recreate and provide real value by means of gifting our skills and time and knowledge to a meaningful set of projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tanzania was the birthplace of humanity long ago.</li>
<li>Zanzibar was instrumental in abolishing slavery.</li>
</ul>
<p>How meaningful is it that we can bring real freedom back to the world starting from this place.</p>
<p>Personally, I have enough, I don’t like where places like Europe are going to, an alternative is needed. Most &quot;none emerging&quot; countries today are stuck and nothing can be realized. </p>
<p>I personally believe Tanzania is so much more powerful and valuable than the average citizen believes. We feel the urge to help Tanzania to protect its resources and create their own independent future as much as possible without being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to a real chance to make a change for the benefit of the country we call our new home for ourselves and our close communities.</p>
<p>We are looking forward for a chance to show that other values can be used to create prosperity:</p>

<p>Of course we understand it's not always easy to achieve the above in the current world situation but we believe we have a real chance to use the technology we have available to be much more aligned with the above table.</p>
