<p><strong>Imagine a unified sovereign internet and digital backbone system which will enable Tanzania a future in which:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>country GDP goes up dramatically thanks to the benefits of a sovereign internet and lots of new economic digital possibilities.</li>
<li>everyone has access to super cost effective
<ul>
<li>quality and reliable internet with lots of localized applications</li>
<li>quality education (farming, school, ...)</li>
<li>quality healthcare</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a unified way how to pay for your services</li>
<li>tax is paid in a fair way to the benefit of the country we live in</li>
<li>corruption is a thing of the past</li>
<li>the government has a way to protect its citizens in any situation</li>
<li>the government and its regulatory bodies have full access and insight to all financial and administrative transactions happening (real time).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Every Tanzania Citizen gets access to a digital backbone which</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>is more resilient against the Cyber Pandemic (hacking)</li>
<li>is reliable and high performance</li>
<li>is cost effective</li>
<li>is local and sovereign (no need to travel thousands of km with your digital life)</li>
<li>cannot lose your data, your personal data is yours</li>
<li>allows you to be you, you are not manipulated</li>
<li>allows you to find any information, service and product for free</li>
<li>allows you to participate in e-commerce in a safe way</li>
<li>allows you to learn and provide services to your community</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is possible today, we would like to help Tanzania to make it happen.</p>
<p>An integrated approach can avoid &quot;the painkiller problem&quot; and compatibility with existing systems.</p>

<p>Tanzania can be one of the first mover of a digital revolution where everyone becomes the center of their digital life.</p>
<p><img src="brave_new_world/img/brave_new_world.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>This would bring incredible benefits:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>National education would improve</li>
<li>National health would improve</li>
<li>Leadership would be recognised for its vision and execution capability</li>
<li>OurTown residents would be proud &amp; delighted to be part of a beautiful Tanzania ready for the future</li>
<li>National GDP would go up</li>
<li>Security would increase</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than implementing all as a painkiller approach (see <a href="brave_new_world/no_pain_killer.html">here</a>), why not go to the root and build a new digital backbone which is done in such a way it resolves the majority of requirements for a country's digital transformation.</p>
<h2 id="imagine-if-the-tanzania-government-can"><a class="header" href="#imagine-if-the-tanzania-government-can">Imagine if the Tanzania government can</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that every relevant party and all assets are documented &amp; authenticated in one national digital system:
<ul>
<li>People: Identity for each OurTown Resident (peer reviewed, with KYC/AML integration if needed)</li>
<li>Land: Land Registry available to everyone where no-one can alter the information if they are not following the right processes and verification steps. Integrated with ultra reliable augmented reality and GPS systems</li>
<li>Companies: Universal company registration with all relevant information available in a unified way. Data super well protected and only modifiable with well-defined processes.</li>
<li>Products: Records of every container coming in &amp; out of the country with contents, purpose, and parties involved, …</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow every OurTown Resident (company or person) to send money to each other in the most transparent way (needs help from mainland):
<ul>
<li>Free of charge for non commercial transactions</li>
<li>Supports offline transactions where either one or zero parties involved are connected to the internet</li>
<li><strong>Can even function where there is no (or limited) electricity!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have insight on every <span style="text-decoration:underline;">commercial</span> transaction which occurs in Tanzania:
<ul>
<li>Parties involved in the transaction (at least one needs to be commercial)</li>
<li>Purpose of the transaction</li>
<li>Specific information for example in a harbour; tax, sales of goods, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow  companies in the country to save 10-30% on operational costs
<ul>
<li>No need to pay to companies like airbnb, bookings.com, tripadvisor, ...</li>
<li>No need for marketing on platforms like google, facebook, ... </li>
<li>Integration &amp; Automation: no need for complicated accounting systems, integrated tax reporting, ...</li>
<li>Hotels: help them get insight about their sales, which waiter does what, … </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have all transactions and other relevant information logged in a system which cannot be corrupted:
<ul>
<li>Information is stored on a quantum safe archive system with blockchain capabilities</li>
<li>Date can never be lost, corrupted or changed; a perfect audit trail for the future</li>
<li>Unlimitedly scalable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be at the forefront of the digital revolution and be recognized for it on a global scale.</li>

<p><strong>Our Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a single sign-on digital authentication system usable for all of a country's digital use cases (like a digital passport) and following standards set by international organizations like the World Bank, African Union, … </li>
<li>Implement a land bank system which covers the full nation and is updated by OurTown Residents, but protected and audited by satellite and a super accurate GPS system</li>
<li>Implement a super efficient TAX system where everyone participates with maximum transparency and minimum cost</li>
<li>Implement Complementary Digital Currencies which OurTown Residents can use for their daily needs</li>
<li>Implement an education system where every OurTown Resident can participate as a teacher and/or a student</li>
<li>Implement a digital health system which can unlock primary health care for everyone at a much lower cost using means already made available by OurTown Residents (knowledge, herbs, best practices, generic medicine, …)</li>
<li>Implement a new digital backbone (internet system) to support all the above with total sovereignty and security</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All of this is not only possible, we have a plan for it and we can be the first ones in the world to pull it off.</strong></p>
<h2 id="lets-do-it-together"><a class="header" href="#lets-do-it-together">Let's do it together</a></h2>
<p>We have ideas on how this can be implemented at the lowest possible cost with maximum benefit for Tanzania.</p>
<p>The basic requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the knowledge stays in the country, incredible opportunities to grow</li>
<li>All required technology (software) in the country is open source, unlimitedly usable and managed by teams in OurTown, ready for the future</li>
<li>All super transparent and done by OurTown, for OurTown</li>

<p><img src="brave_new_world/img/painkillers.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Currently, most countries develop their digital future by implementing many independent projects which all act as painkillers to their problems. While a painkiller might fix symptoms, it rarely solves the root issue.</p>
<p>A country like Tanzania (or Zanzibar) has the opportunity to leapfrog straight to a solution which is both easier to implement and solves most of its issues all at once.</p>
<p>This has huge benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's much more cost effective</li>
<li>It's easier and more integrated which results in many benefits for the users</li>
<li>It will be safer (think about the cyber pandemic happening right now)</li>
<li>It is more prepared for the future</li>
<li>It's greener (such a system will use up to 100 times less energy)</li>

<p>What has IT to do with onions...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: (kristof) check if this is ok</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The development of applications in the IT sphere has been using painkiller methods at each layer of model first patterns to go forward. </p>
<h2 id="model-first-pattern"><a class="header" href="#model-first-pattern">Model First Pattern</a></h2>
<p><img src="brave_new_world/img/model.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A model first pattern has a standardised foundation. When there is a problem or a bug, or when changes are required, it is not possble to change the sublayers, so a new layer is created. Making changes in the middle is affecting everyhting else that is on top, therefore, it requires more work. Layers keep being added on top of the base which adds complexity, si the problem is never fixed at the root. </p>
<p>( NOT NECESSARY) </p>
<p>The model can be seen as a dictionary that keeps on expanding more and more. </p>
<ul>
<li>More but complex words = Harder to understand</li>
<li>Less but simple words = Easy to understand</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, imagine when hundreds of such models are connectted to one another and exchanging information. The more layers each indivdual model has, the heavier it is for its message to get across. The whole system becomes very complex. </p>
<p>The problem here is that individual systems are trying to redo things better, however they are using the same base infrastructure. They simply redefine that base towards a relevant issue. Ths cannot lead to optimal systems since solutions are managed around a single functiion. If multiiple people need to use that function it gets very complicated. </p>
<p>One way to go around this has been to use Enterprise Message Bus: Controlling how models talk to each other by pre-defining the messages exchanged. But this does not solve the problem at the root.</p>
<h2 id="ourtwin-scenario"><a class="header" href="#ourtwin-scenario">OurTwin Scenario</a></h2>
<p><img src="brave_new_world/img/twin_model.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>WITH OurTwin, there is an 'actor' driven pattern instead of a model first pattern. In such a pattern, the root model only holds essentials in its database, hence any necessary changes can be applied at the root. </p>
<p>The model can tap direct into knowledge (how to do certain things) by accessing the 'recipes'. 'Recipes' are the source code that can easily be adapted to any task. By using Domain Specific Language (DSL) it is easy to reuse recipes. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="our-recipe"><a class="header" href="#our-recipe">Our Recipe</a></h1>
<p><img src="brave_new_world/img/recipe.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Together we can make this digital dream happen; we need commitment, a good plan, and most importantly, a loyal team and a strong partnership:</p>
<ul>
<li>A government which is committed to make this work, and be different. Some companies and individuals might not want such a huge step forward. so we need to be ready to defend the project.</li>
<li>A sense of urgency, time is against us, the time is now. The world is changing; now is the best time to reach for our dreams.</li>
<li>Being different and being at the forefront means we need to dare being different. We can't continue to do what everyone else is doing. It clearly isn't working! As Einstein said, <em>“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them”</em>. </li>
<li>Put a structure in place from which all of this can be executed. </li>
<li>Be safe, don’t take unnecessary risks, don’t run before walking, go iterative but  from the ground up with a newly designed sovereign system, based not on hype but on proof.</li>
<li>A solid committed team with all the necessary knowledge, drive and passion, and willing to put in their all to make it happen. We believe ThreeFold can step forward and make it happen. </li>

<p>By building a decentralized Internet backbone infrastructure locally, Tanzania can support it's economic growth and further it's position as a leader in shaping the fintech vision of the region. </p>
<p>The Internet backbone is poised to digitally transform the country, bringing significant developments for citizens, companies and the government itself. </p>
<p>Data is now the most valuable asset in the world, and Tanzania can own it's data. According to statistics, every Internet user is worth about USD 10,000. Imagine the value the Internet backbone would attract just by hosting the data locally. </p>
<p>The future is digital, and the development of the country's fintech sector is more than just a strategy, it is a necessity to attract talent, knowledge and resources to Tanzania. </p>

<p>Together we are confident we can achieve this vision to create a leading digital backbone to empower the future of Zanzibar. An affordable, digitally secure and transparent backbone, and at a later stage, sustainable physical spaces and an incubation center powered by a decentralized internet infrastructure will support the development of a tech startup environment, provide for local training, education and youth empowerment facilities within Zanzibar. The combination of scalable virtual services and sustainably implemented physical spaces will attract foreign investment as well as provide a solid economic model for the country whilst empowering Zanzibar's citizens through job creation and increased economic activity. </p>
<h3 id="empowered-communities"><a class="header" href="#empowered-communities">Empowered Communities</a></h3>
<p>With more women being connected to Tanzania’s new digital backbone, endless opportunities present themselves to Tanzania’s female population.  This allows them to equally participate in the economy and attain access to information to become more self-sufficient and independent leaders. The digital backbone also breaks down the barriers of distance and time, allowing residents of rural areas to participate in economic and civic life far beyond their geographic region. Communications made possible by this  technology eliminates the logistical constraints of regionally-based business models, allowing businesses in isolated areas to compete with their big-city counterparts. </p>
<p>Expanded access to digital services generates major economic growth and rapid job creation. Higher speed connections accelerate business development by providing new opportunities for innovation, expansion, and e-commerce. Connected communities create wealth and opportunity by attracting businesses to their localities.</p>
<p>Advances in information and communications technology means that education is no longer confined to the classroom. Customized  educational tools allow for remote collaboration among fellow students on projects, videoconferences with teachers and real-time video exploration of faraway areas. It helps students in preparing to enter the 21st Century workforce.</p>

<p>Affordable, performant and accessible internet for everyone, empowering the people of Tanzania and Zanzibar.</p>
<p>If the Covid 19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that digital is a necessity. It guarantees the continuity of services in the event of a crisis, and is also essential for ensuring a country’s competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p>To initiate Tanzania’s digital transformation and ensure the social, financial and digital inclusion of all its citizens, the country needs to embark on a digitisation strategy focused on:</p>
<p><img src="ourworld_tnz/img/tnz_city.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Digital Sovereignty and the Unlocking of the Internet Economy</strong></p>
<p>Today, Tanzania's digitial economy relies a lot on the US, Asia, and on European technologies which are deployed and operated in these remote areas. It is a drain on Tanzania as a country, it is GDP negative.  To make Tanzania economy GPD positive, it has to start deploying, operating, and creating local technology to increase the sovereignty of the country instead of being digital dependent on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A sustainable digital transformation can only be achieved if it is founded on digital sovereignty, which is the primary reason for the PPP between the Tanzanian public sector, private sector and Threefold to unlock the Tanzanian internet eocnomy.</p>
<p>Key to this strategy is to establish a sovereign internet infrastructure that ensures Tanzania's digital sovereignty and, more generally, the successful digitalisation of the economy and unlocking of the internet economy.</p>
<p>Three initiatives will spearhead the realization of Tanzania Digital Sovereignty and the unlocking of its Internet Economy. </p>

<p>Healthcare is a fundamental right for every single citizen, the Tanzaznian goverment carries the responsibility to deliver healthcare as a primary civil service. </p>
<p>The challenge in most emerging markets is the lack of healthcare professionals and infrastructure relative to the needs of the community, and the size of the population. This imbalance poses significant challenges for goverment who simply don't have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet its citizens' needs.</p>
<p>Based on our research, the situation on the ground in Tanzania mirrors the same dilemma whenever there is a shortage of budget, infrastructure and healthcare professionals relative to the community needs. It always results in sub-par service delivery of the government. </p>
<h2 id="scaling-healthcare-delivery"><a class="header" href="#scaling-healthcare-delivery">Scaling healthcare delivery</a></h2>
<h3 id="datafication"><a class="header" href="#datafication">Datafication</a></h3>
<p>By definition, 'Datafication' is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into data. This data is realised as a new form of value when it is subsequently transferred into information.</p>
<p>In simple terms, this is the collection of healthcare data and aggregation of medical records to establish a full patient medical history (medical 360). It allows to gain key insights, idenitfy macro health trends and unlock the value of real time data for the benefit of every citizen/patient.</p>
<p>This process involves both historical data aggregation and real time data collection:</p>
<h4 id="historical-data"><a class="header" href="#historical-data">Historical Data</a></h4>
<p>An EMR (electronic medical record) is the aggregation of all historical data from all possible legacy data sources to establish a single and full perspective on a patient history. There is a single healthcare record per citizen:</p>
<ul>
<li>guaranteed private and always in the control of the citizen who owns that data</li>
<li>stored in quantum safe storage on the TSIP network</li>
<li>secured and immutable in the TSIP blockchain </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="real-time-data"><a class="header" href="#real-time-data">Real Time Data</a></h4>
<p>Based on being able to collect and diagnose real time information from patients via a cvrtual healthcare platform, enabling healthecare professionals more insights and data points on which they can make a diagnosis, and recommend an appropriate treatment protocol. In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>data collection is deviceless meaning the patient needs nothing more than a smartphone to provide his information real time, in virtual consultation</li>
<li>data is measured by the smartphone camera and uploaded onto the patient EMR record for diagnosis by the healthcare professional</li>
<li>data is collected real time but it is stored and associated to an active consultation which can be queued awaiting the availability of a healtcare professional who in due course, can use the data to formulate a diagnosis and recommend a treatment protocol. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtualisation"><a class="header" href="#virtualisation">Virtualisation</a></h3>
<p>In computing terms, virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level.</p>
<p>In simple terms, to virtualise healthcare delivery means to digitalise the whole patient experience as far as possible. In essence, make the end to end healthcare process an online experience and minimise the need for a patient to visit a healthcare facility and see a healthcare professional in person.</p>
<p>In practice, it is tele-medicine, although in this case, there are some fundamental diofferences vs what the industry  recognises today. Tele-mendicine has advanced our ability to deliver healthcare significantly by virtualisibg the patient epxerince and by bringing healthcare professionals to the patient via an application. However, whist this has brought greater efficiency in healthcare service delivery, there are still obvious limitations with regards to the scope of practice that could be delivered via a virtual service.</p>
<p>The limitations referred to above are that only minor conditions can be consulted and diagnosed via a virtual platform given the lack of data available between the patient  and the healthcare proifessional. This lack of histiorical and more importantly real time data is still a major limiting factor in the type of cases that can be dealt with an online virtual experience.</p>
<p>More on this key constraint and how it can be overcome in the section below: ###</p>
<h3 id="tokenisation"><a class="header" href="#tokenisation">Tokenisation:</a></h3>
<p>In technical terms, Tokenisation is the process by which an issuer creates digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which represent either digital or physical assets.</p>
<p>In simple terms, a token is a digital representation of something that has inherent value. This can be financial, asset based or other.</p>
<p>Relative to this context, tokenisation means the digitisation of the health budget to allow for simple and fair distribution of value. </p>
<p>In this case, we refer to a digital token backed by, and representing the national health budget, remittable for the redemption of healthcare services on behalf of the government to the citizens of Tazania.</p>
<p>In practice, the process can be as simple as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the national healthcare budget is tokenised and minted on the blockchain in a fully automated process</li>
<li>digital tokens, representing healthcare services by the government, are distributed electronically to the digital wallet of each citizen (typically the digital wallet is on their mobile phone) on a equitable basis.</li>
<li>citizens have then the means to redeem virtual healthcare services using the inherent value of the digital tokens they were issued.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process of tokenisation ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>equitable distribution of value between all citizens</li>
<li>concise and immutable management of budget and resources</li>
<li>key insights and data trends such as:
<ul>
<li>how healthcare infrastructure and resources are utilised</li>
<li>spent per citizen on healthcare</li>
<li>annual cycles in health related problems</li>
<li>geographical data insights realtive to spending and health trends, etc.</li>

<p>Here are some of the significant global findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>94% of youth ages 12-17 who have Internet access say they use the Internet for school research and 78% say they believe the Internet helps them with schoolwork.</li>
<li>71% of online teens say that they used the Internet as the major source for their most recent major school project or report.</li>
<li>41% of online teens say they use email and instant messaging to contact teachers or classmates about schoolwork.</li>
<li>34% of online teens have downloaded an online study aid.</li>

<p><img src="ourworld_tnz/usecases/img/cbdc5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Payment and settlement systems and services have become vital components of the economic life of contemporary societies. Over the last decades, they have gone through several waves of reforms that has changed the landscape of the national payments system (NPS), in virtually every country in the world. Yet, in the middle of the 20th century, as payment technology settled down, payment and settlement systems and services issues were still slightly neglected versus other aspects of the financial system. They were seen mostly as technical matters, or “plumbing”, to be dealt with by sub-units of IT departments at both the central and commercial banks.</p>
<p>Recently, the issuance of Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) has become a highly debated financial-sector topic worldwide. </p>
<p>Rapidly evolving technology and its application to practically all areas of finance, but especially in the issuance of value in electronic forms, has made it possible for central banks to issue their own digital currency for widescale use. The international financial community is currently studying aspects of CBDC, from design to implementation, and the implications for the financial system, including policy, regulation, oversight and the economy more broadly.</p>
<p>CBDC innovative potential to make digital payment services universal, ubiquitous, and instantaneous in contemporary economies must be weighed against the potential risks. </p>
<p>The World Bank asks for careful consideration of</p>
<ul>
<li>the availability of a sound legal and regulatory framework</li>
<li>the availability of an efficient infrastructure that include 
<ul>
<li>information &amp; communicationstechnology</li>
<li>identity</li>
<li>reliable network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strong commitment of relevant stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>A widely available CBDC for retail use could reinforce the central role of central bank money in today’s digital world. </p>
<p>Where appropriate, CBDC could be a way to promote innovation in the NPS and enhance efficiency. Issuance of CBDC is not a full replacement of physical cash or private-sector money, including new digital currencies. All these forms of money can coexist. This coexistence would require a level playing field aimed at ensuring that competition is open and fair,  interoperability essential for an environment that needs to be open to innovation.</p>
<p>From our of <a href="ourworld_tnz/usecases/mama_samia_institute/intro.html">Mama Samia Institute</a> we would like to contribute to the required policies and research to find the right path forward.</p>
<p>The TSIP digital backbone project as suggested in this document implements the technical requirements for this project linked to the capabilities of the digital twin technology. We believe that the TSIP approach is a novel way on how to integrate digital requirements for the future.</p>

<p>Tanzania has already implemented multiple digital payment systems and we believe that the TSIP digital backbone could be a good way to complement them with a unified backend system to allow even more efficiency and widespread usage.</p>
<p>TSIP Unified Payment System has some unique advantages which will complement the existing systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>offline payments (no internet needed)</li>
<li>proof of authenticity (make sure the seller is authentic)</li>
<li>one party payment device, ability to allow people to make payments even if only one of them has a smartphone or computer</li>
<li>QR based payments in all safety, imagine people can make payments with nothing more than scanning a QR code from their phone in all safety </li>
<li><strong>Full automatic integration with tax revenue collection system.</strong></li>

<p>Create the infrastructure layer for an upgraded internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more reliable internet, one which can meet the challenges of the future 
(climate change issues, possibility of unrest, financial crisis, …). </li>
<li>A more sustainable internet, using a lot less energy</li>
<li>A more safe internet</li>
<li>An internet where we can be the center of our digital life with more security, less costs, no middleman, …</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing for</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiences which allow people to be free, safe and self sovereign.</li>
<li>Any application which puts the people in the center and allows them to have full control over their data &amp; future.</li>
<li>New financial systems (DEFI, but different than today's casino-like environment, peer2peer)</li>
<li>Projects which want to build communities to achieve planet positive goals.</li>
<li>Countries that choose to work in a decentralized manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course all of this can only happen by building communities and by collaborating with like minded projects/people.</p>
<h2 id="why-an-upgraded-internet"><a class="header" href="#why-an-upgraded-internet">Why an upgraded Internet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The current internet is very unstable (too centralized fiber cables, data centers, …)</li>
<li>The current internet is very unsafe</li>
<li>The current internet is not distributed enough, only in a few countries.</li>
<li>The current internet is too power hungry.</li>
<li>The current internet is too complicated</li>
<li>The current internet is exploitative, it turned us all into a product.</li>

<ul>
<li>a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold</li>
<li>an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) </li>
<li>a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance based world</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch, an internet which would deliver all the needs for a different future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In each Regional Internet abundance is the base:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of free information, education, knowledge (books, encyclopedias), earth information (maps, videos), art (music, video, …), …</li>
<li>Your applications required for your digital professional and personal life are all free</li>
<li>You can find anything for free, you can promote everything for free.</li>
<li>You can freely exchange anything to anything else (money for good, good for good, money for money, …)</li>
</ul>
<p>This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.</p>

<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets, is not one Internet as owned by the very few. It is thousands of interconnected Internets, where each Internet is founded and grown by a local community. YOU become Troadmaphe Internet.</p>
<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets is our chance to create a beautiful digital world in which we are free and powerful, a world where we can co-create a better future for everyone. We need to say NO to being a product of the large centralized corporations. We need to free ourselves, even from our own brainwashing.</p>
<p>We need a system where we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be free and independent yet fully interconnected over all OurWorld Internet of Internets</li>
<li>Learn and play, grow in awareness and learn from each other</li>
<li>Don’t have to be afraid of an uncertain future where the privileged few define the next steps</li>
<li>Don’t become addicted to the biggest potential drug called money (money is not bad, money can be beautiful, money should be an energy source for change)</li>

<p>Many countries don’t have an internet, they have a long cable to the Internet, this leads to loss in money, data, security, and human resources. It's our aim to support countries in building their Internet and provide economic chances to the ones who have a difficult time catching up in this hectic world.</p>
<p>Key Words:</p>

<li>Sovereignty</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Cost</li>
</ul>
<p>Today most countries lose money because of the Internet, e.g. their citizens using services outside of their country, having to pay a lot for expensive Internet backbone (fiber) services, monetization of citizens data, …</p>
<p>Together with our friends we are talking to some countries who are very open about the possibilities of a sovereign country cloud.</p>

<p>Every day farmers are adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid, we are growing quite well organically. There is a booster to let this happen faster, that's by means of our neighborhood cloud initiative also called INCA.</p>
<p>A neighborhood cloud is like a community driven decentralized data center. The initiative provides residents, businesses, developers and the government in your city with a secure and highly available sovereign cloud infrastructure to store and process their data locally.  ThreeFold works with Real Estate developers to deploy a large amount of Internet capacity in their projects, which is a win-win situation for the developer, the home owner and ThreeFold.</p>
<p>A first project in Dubai for 170 Villa’s has been realized and there is now a funnel of at least 10 more. Each project brings Internet capacity to the local community which is the easiest way to expand the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<p><img src="mission/goals/img/decentralized_dc.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Next to our Neighborhood Cloud expansion model, we support our global Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and commercial farmers. </p>
<p>A 2nd large neighborhood cloud is very close to being signed, this time with even more homes.</p>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/digital_transfo.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Digital transformation is the implementation of digital technology leading to substantial improvements in the way a government or company’s operations and the value it offers to its clients/citizens.</p>
<p>Generally, it’s about evolving how an organization communicates with its customers as well as how they deliver a consistent experience to their customers whenever and wherever they need it.</p>
<p>We believe the state of technology is such that countries can leapfrog into a digital area where many of the current problems will simply no longer exist.</p>
<p>The root cause problems are</p>
<ul>
<li>pain killer approach (never a real solution, keep on patching the issue, this leads to inefficient money spending)</li>
<li>onion problem (exponential growth of complexity)</li>
<li>wrong IT paradigm (data models and client server)</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine a system which</p>
<ul>
<li>scales unlimited and is good for planet (green)</li>
<li>has all relevant data available for all usecases, no reason to do duplication but yet still there is full data privacy where required.</li>
<li>no need for complicated integration projects</li>
<li>is affordable</li>
<li>is sovereign, all data and logic is in country</li>
<li>is super easy to expand</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is possible today with WEB4 and our digital backbone concept.</p>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/globe.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>There are thousands of wonderful projects out there which want to provide value for the world but they miss a framework which helps them in achieving their goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>”The industry is talented in creating solutions to problems that should have never been there.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Much of the current Cloud &amp; Blockchain Industry is way too complicated and fragmented for what they need. </p>
<p>To build something today you need 10+ different systems and integrate them all. Many believe that an ecosystem of different solutions can be stitched together to create something bigger. History has already shown that this is not the case. We call this the ‘Onion Problem’ (more about this in a document I still have to write), but basically it means that systems get so complicated that people don’t dare to change anything inside so everyone keeps on creating other layers on top of the layers which already exist. This leads to even more complicated systems which no-one seems to fully understand and allowing hackers to have a great time because there are hundreds of places to find vulnerabilities in. Blockchain did not make things easier, it became even more difficult and non transparent.</p>
<p>It's difficult for projects to build a system which allows them to scale and work easily with their communities. The systems today are simply too complicated and unsafe (think about current wallets, exchanges, …).</p>
<p>The current way how the internet is created is just wrong, client - server is simply wrong, the fact that we exist 100 times on the internet is wrong, we need Web 4.0. We should not spend any time on anything which is not to the benefit of our Vision and The Planet.</p>
<p>Projects need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trust based system, where people can be themselves and communicate with each other and the project in a safe container with full identity and transparency.</li>
<li>A financial (funding &amp; exchange) system which is safe, fast, reliable and easy to use for everyone.</li>
<li>An application and development platform which allows them to build their &quot;experience&quot; in the fastest possible way with less complexity and no need to re-invent everything (like is the case now).</li>
<li>A storage system where all data &amp; information is stored by the user and owned by the user. An ultra reliable system which can never lose data and which scales to a planetary scale.</li>
<li>An easy system so that less technical people can also use it.</li>
<li>A system which is cost effective, we know projects who went bankrupt by doing good because they could not afford existing centralized cloud systems.</li>
<li>A system which keeps the data in the country where the people live, this leads to more performance and safety.</li>

<p>A beautiful value based Incubator concept with the purpose of helping Tanzania bring sustainable digital economic growth in harmony with nature, local population and government requirements. </p>
<p>The Digitization of Tanzania is inevitable, we have a chance to make it a home grown digitization that considers the values, culture and actual needs of Tanzania rather than importing solutions that are often dependent on external parties that forces the assimilation of Tanzania to foreign requirements. The home grown digitization will unlock the potential of the Tanzanian economy. </p>
<p>We have a unique chance to use digital technology to advance a country's future with full sovereignty and independence.</p>
<p>Young people need actionable hope in the current global climate, it's often hard for them and their future often looks grim. Our future generations need hope and a practical way forward. The Mama Samia Institute wants to be the home for thousands of young people, helping them to create their own regenerative future which can have an impact on millions of people globally. </p>
<p>We do this by using advanced but sustainable technology concepts as well as a value based approach. We are not talkers, we are doers.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>As much as possible, Tanzania companies (with majority shareholding from Tanzania investors) and/or Mama Samia Institute are getting unlimited access to all required Intellectual Property (e.g. sourcecode in case of digital technology, or documents in case of other technology). Vendors who are not willing to open up their knowledge cannot deliver their projects to our country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break down each project to having to use most of the components that can be sourced from within the country, or from outside but then from multiple sources (India, China, Europe, US, etc.), and directly from the manufacturer of the components. This resolves longevity, independence, and reduced pricing, for the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together with the eventual partner (if needed), to create local knowledge centers where the solutions can be recreated from the components as mentioned above without help from outside. The funding for such  local centers need to come from project financing and the business case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a large enough stock of replacement components as part of each project to make sure that continuation can be maintained if the global supply chain has hiccups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask for the most simple solutions which are just good enough for the requirements which are respectful of the country resources and its people. Often things can be done in a much more simple way as vendors would like us to believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All products or services delivered need to be operated from TNZ/ZNZ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No data can leave the country, all applications need to be hosted inside TNZ/ZNZ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No product can have backdoors allowing others access into systems as deployed in the country.
In case backdoors cannot be removed, sufficient protection mechanisms need to be created to try and mitigate the issues. </p>

<p>Do not sell out natural resources of TNZ and ZNZ, it's too easy right now for companies and people from outside to leverage the natural resources and divert the profits made from it outside the country. Resources from TNZ and ZNZ belong to people living in TNZ and ZNZ, as such these resources need to be protected and valued in the right way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Telecom infrastructure (4G/5G), eventually even with local manufacturing</li>
<li>Internet Infrastructure and most of its components</li>
<li>Electric vehicles (batteries, simple cars and bicycles, …)</li>

<h3 id="how-can-this-be-done"><a class="header" href="#how-can-this-be-done">How can this be done?</a></h3>
<p>We will build amazing locations in TNZ/ZNZ where top talent = high quality engineers, coders and technologists and their families will want to reside. These top talents will get free housing, 100% tax exemption for the time they work to deliver on the promise of ISP and most importantly a margin share in the success of the ISP project(s).</p>
<p>The Mama Samia Institute can be used as a validating point for the implementation of this approach, our aim is to also facilitate startups which can practically work on delivering some of the solutions 100% from within the country.</p>
<h3 id="reality-check"><a class="header" href="#reality-check">Reality check</a></h3>
<p>This ambitious goal will not be achieved in one year, it will require time to materialize and a shift in mentality where many in the country believe we have to rely on resources from outside and we don’t have enough belief in our own capabilities and value in relation to a global world.</p>

<p>Tanzania is one of the richest countries in the world in relation to natural resources. TNZ literally sits on a goldmine. Mama Samia Institute wants to help create and research policies which can help conserve wealth and come up with strategies which allows collaboration with other nations in a sustainable way without sacrificing natural wealth. Mama Samia Institute would like to offer this research and suggestions to relevant ministries and other government instances.</p>
<h3 id="some-ideas"><a class="header" href="#some-ideas">Some ideas</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Foundations without shareholders are a practical way how land or mines can be owned without handing over control and too much of the profit to external shareholders. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology can resolve a lot. Practical satellite technology, blockchain and DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) mechanisms can be used to make sure that there is a fair contribution in the country. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than using debt based instruments, shariah compliant investment mechanisms are more safe to protect the wealth of TNZ and ZNZ.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Attract grants (not loans) from outside of the country to fund a large part of this work and hire required talent.</p>

<h2 id="threefold"><a class="header" href="#threefold">ThreeFold</a></h2>
<p>50m USD has been spent to create technology for a new internet, all has been done, the roll out is happening. We are willing to donate 20% of the shares of Threefold to Mama Samia Institute.</p>
<p>We are looking for ways to move the HQ from ThreeFold to ZNZ or TNZ.</p>
<p>ThreeFold will be valued +500m USD in the near future, and billions not much later, let's use this opportunity to make healthy PR for Tanzania and Zanzibar as a possible safe technology hub.</p>
<p>We can deliver a full blown internet experience for less than 1 USD per person per month.</p>

<h2 id="ourledger"><a class="header" href="#ourledger">OurLedger</a></h2>
<p>Tanzania or Zanzibar does not need an American or Chinese blockchain as the base for its future digital currencies or for other blockchain requirements. We suggest to create a new company at least 51% owned by MSI which will deliver blockchain technology to TNZ, ZNZ and around. The technology delivered will be truly fully decentralized, with blockchain nodes in the region and with no backdoors. The sourcecode will be available and a lot of attention will go to make sure that the countries who use this blockchain technology have met their requirements without losing their sovereignity. This blockchain can be used for digital currencies even for a Central Bank Powered Currency, digital identity, land ownership, etc. All knowledge and technology will be available in the country.</p>

<p><img src="mama_samia_institute/img/header.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>The Internet is one of mankind’s greatest achievements. More than ever, it is playing a crucial role in our evolution to the point that internet access has become a human right. However, still today more than 3 billion people have no access to the internet, especially in developing countries. That is because the current internet infrastructure consists of hyper-scale data centers that are extremely costly and hard to deploy.</p>
<p>Still, over 1 billion people and 70 billion devices are expected to join the digital economy by 2025. Digital inclusion as well as the emergence of Edge Computing, Blockchain, Big Data and the Internet of Things requires Internet capacity to expand well beyond its current limitations.</p>
<p>Today, there are only two options available: to build power-hungry, hyper-scale data centers that cost billions (if not trillion) of dollars and require expert maintenance and sales teams; or to give up on data ownership and outsource infrastructure requirements to the tech giants that already own the majority of all Internet infrastructure and networks today.</p>
<p>Net neutrality is at stake and humanity deserves a better alternative than a centralized and unsustainable system benefiting a handful of companies that turn people into products.</p>
<p>Powered by our open source technology, we have created an open, autonomous and regenerative Internet infrastructure that can scale limitlessly. It flips the current centralized model upside down, and allows anyone to join the world’s largest and fastest growing economy in the world - the Internet and cloud economy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="some-100-owned-startups"><a class="header" href="#some-100-owned-startups">Some 100% owned startups</a></h2>
<p>We would like to create some startups which are 100% owned by MSI and as such generate profit for MSI.</p>
<p>Two examples who will require some more explanation</p>
<ul>
<li>CBDC = Central Bank Digital Currency for TNZ/ZNZ</li>
<li>Gold (maybe Tanzanite or other materials) Token based financing and mining</li>
<li>Carbon credit farming &amp; exchange platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Example about the carbon credit farming projects: it is very beneficial for Tanzania as well as to the investors who might want to invest in such a startup. These carbon credits would be digitized by blockchain technology as provided by ThreeFold and the Mama Samia Institute. We want to fundraise money for a carbon farming startup in Tanzania with massive ICV (In Country Value), Protecting land and farming carbon credits are a possibility today providing good for everyone involved. For this project, we work with Take Action Global who will be an integral part of our Institute, see <a href="https://www.takeactionglobal.org/">https://www.takeactionglobal.org/</a>. They have very concrete and well working programs to enable youth through education to deliver on the promise of climate change and provide concrete benefits for them and their families.</p>

<h2 id="direct-investors-in-mama-samia-institute"><a class="header" href="#direct-investors-in-mama-samia-institute">Direct Investors in Mama Samia Institute</a></h2>
<p>Together we fundraise 50m USD in Mama Samia Institute. We give out 20% of the shares of MSI to investors.</p>
<p>The investors get following benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferential co-investment rights, they can invest upto 10x their investment into startups coming out of MSI. Example if an investor invests 2m USD in MSI, they can invest 20m USD in the startups coming out of MSI. The startups from MSI give absolute preferential rights to these investors</li>
<li>Investors in the startups of the MSI always get liquidation preference on their investments, which means in case a startup has a less big exit as expected, they get their money back first</li>
<li>Investors get Tax exemption on capital gains on their investment in the Institute as well as in the startups of the Institute (using their co-investment rights)</li>
<li>Investors get preferential right to commercialize the products and services as offered by these startups</li>
<li>They can leverage the knowledge and research capabilities of MSI for their own companies without having to pay for it. All knowledge is available to them. Regular training sessions will be organized which are available for employees of the investor</li>
<li>They get a return on their investment as the Institute grows, the shares will be made liquid by means of a regulated Security Token Offering.</li>
</ul>
<p>This 50m USD will be a required first step to get us going.</p>
<h2 id="grants"><a class="header" href="#grants">Grants</a></h2>
<p>MSI will create a department of talented people who know how to apply for grants and get money in a safe (not debt based) way without sacrificing any of our policies as defined in NWCP and ISP.</p>
<p>We expect to be able to mobilize +50m USD of grants per year within a couple of years.</p>
<h2 id="sponsoring-from-partners"><a class="header" href="#sponsoring-from-partners">Sponsoring from partners.</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The institute is looking for sponsors</li>
<li>The institute grows knowledge and opportunities for its ecosystem</li>
<li>The institute will provide valuable knowledge to every company or organization in Tanzania and around</li>
<li>The institute would be very happy to share this knowledge to any sponsor free of charge</li>
<li>One of the key question the institute tries to answer is how can organizations be more effective with collaboration, IT systems, security, cloud and tools. Being effective in a highly dynamic environment is important, this is super valuable information which can benefit all participants</li>
<li>This information will be free of charge and training sessions / seminars will be created to allow the Samia Institute Sponsors to create value for their own communities</li>
<li>The help from the sponsors is highly appreciated and will also be mentioned on the website of the institute</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exits"><a class="header" href="#exits">Exits</a></h2>
<p>The institute will get meaningful exits which means serious cash will come because of exits. Kristof and Incubaid are willing to donate shares of their startups to MSI which might be worth hundreds of millions within 5 years.</p>
<p>New startups will also generate exits and liquidity, these proceeds can be used to further grow the Institute.</p>
<p>Next to the financial gain, these exits will be PR wise very important for our country.</p>

<p>TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) has been developed by industry experts alongside the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and has emerged as the unchallenged standard for the most demanding and professional users of radio communications worldwide.</p>
<p>TETRA technology brings new outstanding features to mobile communications by combining the features of mobile phones with fast data communications and the work group capabilities of PMR. Key services differentiating TETRA from other wireless technologies include:</p>
<p>Individual simplex and duplex calls, group calls, pre-emptive emergency and priority calls, dynamic group number assignment, call authentication, late entry, voice encryption, packet data services.
Full interoperability (IOP) with all TETRA terminals allow to freely choose and combine any of your favourite terminal brands.</p>

<p><img src="ourbackbone/drnet/../issues/img/centralized_digital_backbone.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>TETRA is a standard for ultra reliable communication networks, ThreeFold is complementing the communication standard with integrated Data and Compute capabilities using our ultra secure Zero-OS system.</p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA equipment lasts. Investments in infrastructure easily cover 10-15 years in the core and even longer for base stations. Devices have been shown to have a typical lifespan of 7-10 years in the field. Users, operators and investors rely on the very well documented standard, constantly being maintained, evolved and improved by ETSI.</p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA has been developed from the bottom up to meet the needs of critical users. </p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA provides multi-vendor choice – allowing customers to switch from one supplier to another without sacrificing the multitude of functions and features ThreeFold TETRA provides.</p>
<p>Control room vendors have their systems tightly integrated with ThreeFold TETRA networks, and many users have optimised operational processes around the flexible capabilities of ThreeFold TETRA.</p>
<p>We at ThreeFold have partnered with TETRA standards to extend our Critical Operations network approach.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-technologies--one-software"><a class="header" href="#multiple-technologies--one-software">Multiple technologies – one software</a></h3>
<p>With everything covered by one system, operation, maintenance and repairs are simply easy. Multi-technology networks can be managed in a single network management tool with one central subscriber register.  Applications like dispatchers and voice and data log systems can be used across all technologies, and all technologies use the same gateways.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-sharing"><a class="header" href="#frequency-sharing">Frequency sharing</a></h3>
<p>Frequency sharing allows adjacent nodes to use the same frequencies. This is a significant benefit in low-density networks and gives the possibility to cover e.g. a railway line with just two frequency pairs.</p>
<h3 id="simplify-repeater-systems"><a class="header" href="#simplify-repeater-systems">Simplify repeater systems</a></h3>
<p>With frequency sharing you can build an indoor repeater system without optical fibres. The same hardware can be used as base station and repeater unit, increasing redundancy and simplifying the network architecture by having one unified network management system and reduced spare part stock.</p>
<h2 id="base-station-geo-redundancy"><a class="header" href="#base-station-geo-redundancy">Base station geo-redundancy</a></h2>
<p>You can bring network availability to a new level. Two nodes located at two sites can act as one fully redundant base station, sharing the same frequencies. This will add redundancy not only to the base station, but also to the whole antenna system.</p>
<h2 id="reduce-infrastructure-costs-with-vhf"><a class="header" href="#reduce-infrastructure-costs-with-vhf">Reduce infrastructure costs with VHF</a></h2>
<p>Save on infrastructure costs by utilizing VHF frequencies to obtain the same coverage as UHF using fewer base stations.</p>
<h2 id="rugged-and-compact-design"><a class="header" href="#rugged-and-compact-design">Rugged and compact design</a></h2>
<p>Built to withstand harsh conditions – from extreme cold to extreme heat and wet conditions thanks to its IP65 encapsulation. Its compact and light-weight design makes it easy to install everywhere from masts to tunnels and on the back of a truck.</p>
<h2 id="no-single-point-of-failure"><a class="header" href="#no-single-point-of-failure">No single point of failure</a></h2>
<p>At the core is a decentralized architecture, which ensures that all system information is constantly available to all sites in the network. This means that the system does not have any single point of failure. This way, local call and data traffic will run without interruption, even if one site loses its connection to the rest of the network.</p>
<h2 id="flexible-and-future-proof"><a class="header" href="#flexible-and-future-proof">Flexible and future-proof</a></h2>
<p>The flat decentralized IP architecture and intuitive software also enable effortless, self-configuring site expansion. Can be used with single or multiple carriers as well as single or multiple technologies, giving you maximum flexibility.</p>

<p><img src="ourbackbone/drnet/img/critical_ops_reqs.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="critical-communication"><a class="header" href="#critical-communication">Critical Communication</a></h2>
<p>Critical communication users often operate in dangerous situations within challenging environments. Trusted communication capabilities are very important for these users, and in extreme situations the communication channel is vitally important – it can literally save lives. Therefore it is essential that critical communications users can control the communications. The key control aspects are service availability, quality of service, operational management and cost.</p>
<p>Communication services need to be available always and everywhere – it is impossible to predict when and where incidents take place. Good geographical radio coverage (both on network and off network) is the most important vehicle needed for high service availability. Resiliency solutions (for the critical communication network, for the transmission network...) are other important high availability enablers.</p>
<p>However, high service availability is not enough, the quality of communication services needs to match with the user requirements. This means that communication services need to seamlessly support users’ operational processes. Users need to have inter-operable services and prioritisation of communication needs in order to work effectively between users/user organisations and switch efficiently between routine and emergency communication.</p>
<p>Communication needs vary depending on incidents and applied operational processes. It is important that there are means for adjusting the communication structure efficiently – this includes for example creating new communication groups, priorities, managing group memberships and combining different groups. This kind of operational management needs to be addressed autonomously and independently by critical user organisations.</p>
<h2 id="available"><a class="header" href="#available">AVAILABLE</a></h2>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA network availability is critical to ensure mission-critical communications. ThreeFold TETRA networks are designed to fulfil very high availability levels – typically between 99.95 to 99.999% for operation of ThreeFold TETRA core and access (base station) components.</p>
<p>This level of availability can only be achieved by using redundancy in order to protect against equipment failures. The status of the redundant components must be kept synchronised with the active components to allow instant failover without the intervention of the network operator.</p>
<p>Battery backup and component redundancy can also be included in the base station design in order to improve availability. Furthermore, coverage redundancy by overlapping base station sites may be considered in the network design to further enhance availability.</p>
<p>In addition to equipment redundancy, link redundancy to the base station must also be considered. Link redundancy is essential to achieve high network-wide coverage availability, important for ThreeFold TETRA radio users to stay in contact with the control room and other ThreeFold TETRA radio users outside the coverage area of the base station.</p>
<p>As a last resort, ThreeFold TETRA base stations support local fallback mode, allowing ThreeFold TETRA radio users to continue communication within the base station coverage area when no links are available to the core infrastructure. Specific ThreeFold TETRA features are developed to give base stations with network-wide coverage priority above isolated ones.</p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA networks are designed and built to fulfil these critical availability requirements, and ThreeFold TETRA network operators have full control in order to benefit from these high availability solutions.</p>
<h2 id="instant"><a class="header" href="#instant">INSTANT</a></h2>
<p>When dealing with public safety and security critical communications, time is of the essence; instant reactions in emergencies are crucial as even a small delay can mean the difference between life and death. Similarly, within business and industrial critical communication, instantly available communication and information is vital to ensure a minimum of downtime and thereby a minimum of economic losses.</p>
<p>With instant communication at its core, ThreeFold TETRA is built for such situations. Call setup is immediate, and important calls can be given pre-emptive status to ensure timeslot availability. Furthermore, the caller is given instant visual and audible feedback in case the called party is unreachable or busy.</p>
<p>Likewise, SDS messages are delivered instantly so can also be used for emergency purposes. The instant SDS feature enables real-time tracking of mobile devices and on-the-spot DGNA group creation, making it possible to deliver a fast and accurate response to emergencies in the field.</p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA instantly provides comprehensive and accurate voice and data recording facilities and a wide range of logging facilities for CDR, enabling fast and easy incident reconstruction and traceability. Among other things, this means immediate access to voice recordings for playback, eliminating the need for additional clarifying calls in life-critical situations where time is of the essence.</p>
<p>A ThreeFold TETRA system is up and running as soon as the power is switched on. In case of operational failure, there is a built-in automatic recovery system supporting switchover to hot standby components or graceful degradation of the system in order to maintain instant communication.</p>
<h2 id="secure"><a class="header" href="#secure">SECURE</a></h2>
<p>Communication security is an essential prerequisite for the success of critical operations.</p>
<p>The protection against eavesdropping and manipulation of voice and data as well as the exclusion of third-party use are therefore indispensable requirements for critical communication systems. This is particularly true against the background of increasing cybercrime.</p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA’s security features, developed by critical communication experts, are modular and complement each other to meet the security requirements of critical applications. They are an integral part of the standard and thus guarantee security even when using devices and infrastructure from different manufacturers.</p>
<p>The ThreeFold TETRA standard supports powerful mutual authentication of a device on the one hand and the network on the other. This makes it possible for a ThreeFold TETRA system to control the access to it and for a device to check if a network can be trusted. In addition, applications enable authentication down to the user level.</p>
<p>If a device is lost or stolen it is fundamental in a critical environment to exclude this device from using the network. ThreeFold TETRA supports different options for a direct secure disabling over the air. The disabling can be either temporary, which leaves the possibility to enable again, or permanent which is irreversible.</p>
<p>As any air interface is very vulnerable to eavesdropping, ThreeFold TETRA provides air interface encryption where user and signalling information is encrypted over the air interface between devices and infrastructure, both for individual and group communications. The air interface encryption mechanism is available for voice and data and direct mode operation. The use of several encryption algorithms, both standard and proprietary, also is supported.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption service can be realised in ThreeFold TETRA in any number of ways. This means that a user organisation may easily tailor an end-to-end encryption system to its own requirements. This flexibility is essential and unique in ThreeFold TETRA, which can be implemented in many forms for different user groups.</p>
<p>The security management features of ThreeFold TETRA allow the user organisation to control, manage and operate the individual security mechanisms. They form the heart of the security and guarantee that the security features are integrated into a consistent security system. As key management is the most essential security management function, a large number of features are integrated to support it. The ThreeFold TETRA standard security mechanism will be regularly enhanced to guarantee secure communication to 2035 and beyond.</p>
<p>In addition the all-IP design of ThreeFold TETRA networks enables the use of state-of-the-art external protection devices such as firewalls.</p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA networks are able to operate either completely stand alone, i.e. disconnected from the Internet, or integrated into the user organisations’ communication and IT environment, which enables the use of the protection mechanism of the organisation against cyberattacks and other threats.</p>
<h2 id="customised-coverage"><a class="header" href="#customised-coverage">CUSTOMISED COVERAGE</a></h2>
<p>In critical operations, communication services need to be available everywhere as it is impossible to predict where incidents, emergencies and disruption of operations may occur.</p>
<p>Extensive geographical network radio coverage is fundamental even in sparsely populated areas such as rural, mountain or desert regions where there is usually no or insufficient service from public cellular networks.</p>
<p>ThreeFold TETRA can provide rich and efficient off-network communication capabilities that allow field users to communicate everywhere (even outside network coverage) and in any occurrence (when the network is unavailable, overloaded, or to communicate independently from the network for local operations) through direct connection between devices (DMO – Direct Mode Operation).</p>
<p>Off-network direct communications can be further optimised in terms of coverage range through the use of devices acting as DMO repeaters or DMO gateways, the latter providing a local extension of a network base station to users operating in DMO (e.g. to provide immediate and prompt in-tunnel or in-door service).</p>
<p>Only dedicated communication networks can provide such a required level of service coverage and ThreeFold TETRA is natively conceived and constantly enhanced to provide extensive and cost effective coverage. ThreeFold TETRA can operate in low frequency bands thus minimising the required number of network sites and the high level of competition typical of the ThreeFold TETRA market catalyses continuous product improvement. Today ThreeFold TETRA radio terminals and base stations offer extremely optimised receivers with sensitivity levels well beyond the minimum required by the standard, thereby dramatically further improving ThreeFold TETRA coverage capabilities and cost effectiveness.</p>
<h2 id="off-network"><a class="header" href="#off-network">OFF NETWORK</a></h2>
<p>There are always circumstances both planned and unplanned when it is essential for mission critical users to operate outside the coverage of their network. It is a fundamental requirement to ensure that communications can be maintained between operational groups of users regardless of the scenarios they find themselves in.</p>
<p>Operation outside network coverage might be needed for a variety of reasons: to compensate for poor network signal strength areas, when service from a local base station site is lost, or there is a prior knowledge of operating in an area where there is no or poor network coverage. ThreeFold TETRA provides a range of off-network services to enable users to retain key services such as group calls, point to point calls, emergency calls and pre-emption, text messages and to maintain security and encryption used on network. ThreeFold TETRA’s off-network services are comprehensive and provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back-to Back operation – communication directly between two or more devices</li>
<li>Repeater Operation – range extension using a standard ThreeFold TETRA device acting as a relay between other devices</li>
<li>Gateway operation – range extension back to the ThreeFold TETRA network, connecting devices working off-network to the ThreeFold TETRA network to maintain wide area coverage.</li>
<li>Long range communications – back-to back operation can extend to more than 3 km for handheld devices and much further for in-vehicle devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Off network services are provided in all standard ThreeFold TETRA devices and can be activated by the user simply selecting the required mode of operation.</p>
<h2 id="variety-of-devices"><a class="header" href="#variety-of-devices">VARIETY OF DEVICES</a></h2>
<p>The world’s critical users have a wide variety of requirements and use cases. Devices need to be available for many different types of use and be robust enough to withstand use in extreme environments while still delivering return on investment through length of service. Products are designed from first principles to be critical and secure, negating the need for constant security patches. Devices operate in a real time manner, performing their communications tasks within strict performance criteria and have predictable and repeatable responses to all critical actions (e.g. emergency button press), regardless of how the device is being used. The ThreeFold TETRA ecosystem covers a wide variety of use cases and devices are available in many form factors to suit user requirements. These include devices designed for front line public safety usage, for use in a range of vehicles: motorcycles, cars, vans, aircraft, boats, within control centre environments and for covert installations.</p>
<p>Devices are designed and built for durability, with a field deployment expectation of between five and seven years and supported life of much longer. Devices are designed with components that have long term support ensuring that products can be manufactured, maintained and supported throughout their life. All devices are supported by a wide variety of specialist accessories to fit the exacting needs of critical users’ demands.</p>
<p>All ThreeFold TETRA devices are subject to TCCA’s stringent and independently managed interoperability testing process, ensuring that a wide variety of cost effective compatible solutions from multiple vendors are available.</p>

<p><img src="ourbackbone/digitaltransformation/img/digitaltransformation.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="what-is-digital-transformation"><a class="header" href="#what-is-digital-transformation">What is Digital Transformation?</a></h2>
<p>Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a nation, fundamentally changing how you operate and interact with your citizens, corporations and other nations. It's also a cultural change that requires Tanzania to continually challenge the status quo, experiment, and get comfortable with failure.</p>
<p>Digital transformation has so many possible interpretations and facets, extending from going paperless, to integrating machine learning and AI into your systems. Therefore, Tanzania need to make sure that it has a coherent and effective plan for how it will digitally transform and establish itself as a leader in tech and sustainability in Africa.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-digital-transformation-so-important"><a class="header" href="#why-is-digital-transformation-so-important">Why is Digital Transformation so important?</a></h2>
<p><img src="ourbackbone/digitaltransformation/img/transformation_aspects.jpeg" alt="transformation_aspects" /></p>
<p>National governments are the stewards of their digital agendas, leading cross-sectoral directions of growth, investment and coordination. In adopting digital transformation as a government policy, Tanzania will inspire the digitization of all elements of Tanzanian society. This  national harmonization around shared policies, platforms, and peer learning, encouraged by a strong approach to digital transformation, will magnify Tanzania's ability to realise its goals.</p>
<p>Digital Transformation is so important because it will help make Tanzania a global leader in the following ideals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Sovereignty</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sustainability"><a class="header" href="#sustainability">Sustainability</a></h3>
<p>Digital Transformation allows Tanzania to hold all its citizens and foreign influences to account over their environmental practices. No longer will big multinationals be able to abuse their influence and dump their externalities onto the people of Zanzibar. Moreover, such transformation will encourage both the learning of exciting new technologies from around the world, but create the environment necessary, within Tanzania, for a thriving and innovative sustainable tech community.</p>
<h3 id="sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#sovereignty">Sovereignty</a></h3>
<p>The Digital Transformation of Tanzania will allow it to reclaim control over its data. In the status quo, the majority of data in Zanzibar is processed and stored by Europe and the US. Not only does this present huge issues in terms of sustainability and efficiency, but it also means that Tanzania's citizens don't truly own their data. </p>
<h3 id="efficiency"><a class="header" href="#efficiency">Efficiency</a></h3>
<p>Tanzania will also be able to streamline many processes, both at a governmental and corporate level, freeing up valuable resources for exciting new projects and developments.</p>

<p><img src="ourbackbone/digitaltransformation/img/dtransf_net.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>No matter the size of your business, a successful digital transformation strategy begins with the leadership team having a clear understanding and vision of what the business is transforming into, experts agreed.</p>
<p>As businesses continue to pursue their transformation initiatives, accelerated over the past year by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential they avoid the missteps that can lead to failure. This overview of the six key reasons why organizations encounter digital transformation failures — and advice on how your organization can avoid these hurdles — will help your teams build a digital transformation roadmap that brings business value.</p>
<h3 id="lacking-the-correct-mindset"><a class="header" href="#lacking-the-correct-mindset">Lacking the correct mindset</a></h3>
<p>Not having the right transformation mindset is often the first reason why digital transformation initiatives can either regress, underperform or fail outright, according to Gartner’s Moyer. People are naturally averse to change, but our transformation leaders can play a pivotal role in helping bring about the mindset change required for successful transformations, she added.</p>
<p>“Our leaders really need to get behind the transformation. They need to set the tone, they need to model the behaviors for transformation and then they need to operationalize those behaviors,” Moyer said.</p>
<p>Another mindset that drives digital transformation failures is when the rest of the organization views IT as a “necessary evil”/ Leaders who act as an engine for change and education — instead of just being execution partners — and have the executive buy-in from the very beginning will be successful in establishing IT as a transformation enabler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s really up to the country leader ship to educate and convince people that this is the direction that the country should go.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="not-having-the-right-culture"><a class="header" href="#not-having-the-right-culture">Not having the right culture</a></h3>
<p>An organization’s inherent culture can make or break an organization’s transformation initiatives. Culture change is at the heart of digital transformation, and existing cultures that are going to be more successful with digital transformation are going to be those that embrace change and collaboration.</p>
<p>That’s because, regardless of whether it’s changing products, internal operations or how a company engages with customers, digital transformation always involves getting different departments and different groups within departments to work together in a more coherent and effective way.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have a culture of collaboration across the different functions, across different divisions, the transformation is really going to fail,” Eggplant’s Edwards said.</p>
<p>Change management is a key component in bringing about successful culture change; effective change management can identify people who are most resistant to change and then provide them with the right training and education to turn them into digital transformation champions.</p>
<p>This is why we suggest to leverage the capabilities of the Mama Samia Institute.</p>
<h3 id="not-having-the-right-talent"><a class="header" href="#not-having-the-right-talent">Not having the right talent</a></h3>
<p>Unavailability of appropriate talent to drive transformation initiatives is another factor why digital transformation failures happen.</p>
<p>By finding people with the right skills for your digital transformation team can be a challenge. So much so, that even the pandemic-induced unemployment rate hasn’t loosened up the talent market, Moyer said. There’s still a dearth of talent in high-demand fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Devin Redmond, co-founder and CEO of Theta Lake, advised companies to hire people who are aware of what can go wrong with such initiatives and can actually impart that knowledge to the rest of the organization. These change agents can help create the right focus, business processes and training procedures needed for success.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-clear-goals"><a class="header" href="#lack-of-clear-goals">Lack of clear goals</a></h3>
<p>Governments need to understand what the key areas of focus are and what they are trying to achieve from the business point of view — be it reducing costs, or being more agile or being more secure</p>
<p>Not defining clear goals means your project will end up with people going in lots of different directions; there will be no alignment and, eventually, it will lead to failure, Edwards reinforced.</p>
<p>Like any change initiative, the number one thing is just to make sure you have got your goals defined properly and then defining initiatives that actually deliver those goals.</p>
<p>Doing technology for the sake of technology has always been a bad idea.</p>
<h3 id="failing-to-think-through-the-required-technology"><a class="header" href="#failing-to-think-through-the-required-technology">Failing to think through the required technology</a></h3>
<p>When implementing digital transformation projects, focusing solely on the enabling technology of a subarea can lead to failure.</p>
<p>Say, for example, a business in a highly regulated industry is looking at enabling a video-first communication environment. If it only focuses on how a tool like Zoom or WebEx can improve employee communication and fails to consider the compliance implications of the new software, the project will get held up, Redmond said.</p>
<p>Everyone should be doing that research in advance to say, ‘OK, I should be looking at the full stack of technology if I’m going to be sharing information in a new way, and I need to have new security and compliance infrastructure in place, and I need to involve those other constituencies,'” </p>

<p><img src="tfgrid/theinternet/img/theinternet.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet is the global system of interconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer networks</a> that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">Internet protocol suite</a> (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. </p>
<p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, cabling or radio links, repeaters, modems etc. An Internet Protocol address (IP address), a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, enables us to the Internet Protocol for communication and store/run data on the infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, e-mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony (calls), file sharing, and streaming media services.</p>
<p>Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in centralized data centers owned by a few large corporations. This centralized model is inefficient, as through it's centralized model, if the main servers go down, the whole system experiences downtime. Hundreds of downtime events have been recorded throughout the last few years. Also, given these companies own the data centers, they also own the data that is contained in them and use it for profit reasons. </p>

<h1 id="the-internet-data-centers"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-data-centers">The Internet Data Centers</a></h1>
<p>Today the Internet is mainly delivered out of data centers, which are huge facilities containing up to millions of servers. They centralize shared IT operations and equipment for the purposes of storing, processing, and disseminating data and applications. Data centers have become a foundational necessity of today's Internet, but there are several significant issues with them:</p>
<h2 id="centralization"><a class="header" href="#centralization">Centralization</a></h2>
<p>The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute and storage (and network) infrastructures. Also, this global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China. This means that most of today's Internet is out of reach of billions of people in developing nations particularly in South America, Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<h2 id="cost"><a class="header" href="#cost">Cost</a></h2>
<p>It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyperscale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients. To meet the projected growth of the Internet in 2022, $5 trillion would have to be invested with this model.</p>
<h2 id="energy-consumption"><a class="header" href="#energy-consumption">Energy Consumption</a></h2>
<p>Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage an around 205 TWh of energy - more than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.</p>
<h2 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<p>The current IT stack depends on human infallibility and as such, human error has been considered the primary cause of 95% of cybersecurity breaches. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information.</p>
<h2 id="cannot-support-future-demand"><a class="header" href="#cannot-support-future-demand">Cannot Support Future Demand</a></h2>
<p>To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will need to be built and will consume an additional 400 GW/h. This is roughly equivalent to Japan’s energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.</p>

<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-be-local"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-needs-to-be-local">The Internet Needs To Be Local</a></h2>
<p><img src="tfgrid/theinternet/img/internet_bandwidth.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet today is constructed in a centralized way. The hyperscale data centers that form the backbone of the Internet's infrastructure play a massive role in our digital lives, and they are often located far from users, particularly those living in developing countries or regions. Each time we take an online action such as posting a photo or sending a message, the data is transmitted from our device to that centralized data center, and to the person or persons on the other end. So, you can begin to see how proximity to these servers plays a role in the end user experience.</p>
<p>Internet bandwidth refers to the amount of information or data that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for speed, but they are not the same. Whereas bandwidth is how much information you receive in a given time, speed is how fast that information is received.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of filling a swimming pool with water. If the hose has a wide circumference, more water can flow than if the hose were narrow. In this instance, water is the bandwidth and the rate at which the water flows is the speed.</p>
<p>There are many factors that go into both bandwidth and speed. An end-to-end network path usually consists of multiple connections, each with different bandwidth capacity. And the link with the lowest bandwidth can limit the overall capacity of all connections in the path. When data travels shorter distances, this is less of a factor. Network congestion (usage) is also a major factor. And it's pretty clear to see how by traveling long distances, this would become a bigger problem.</p>

<p><img src="internet_of_internets/img/internet_of_internets.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To create an upgraded abundance-based internet system we need to provide following three pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold</li>
<li>an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) </li>
<li>a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance-based world</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch; an internet which would deliver all the needs for a better future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.</p>
<p>In each OurWorld Internet, abundance is the foundation:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of free information, education, knowledge (books, encyclopedias), earth information (maps, videos), art (music, video, …), …</li>
<li>All applications required for your digital professional and personal life are all free</li>
<li>You can find everything for free, you can promote anything for free.</li>
<li>You can freely exchange anything for anything else (money for goods, goods for goods, money for money, …)</li>
<li>There is no need for interest, lending money can be organized differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-integrated-defi"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-integrated-defi">The Internet of Internets integrated DEFI.</a></h2>
<p>Each Regional Internet hosts and connects to its own set of blockchains and web4 and banking4 functions, which interact with global public blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, Casper Labs, Cosmos, Stellar, Algorand and all the rest...</p>
<p>Each Regional Internet is responsible for their</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity &amp; reputation management of the members of their community.</li>
<li>DEFI blockchain with links to any other possible blockchain as required.</li>
<li>DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization </li>
</ul>
<p>Each Regional Internet hosts a capable decentralized financial system (DEFI) which operates on multiple levels:</p>
<p>This Ourworld DEFI system is unique because it allows the integration of any other local or global blockchain token in such a way that the token is usable from within the OurWorld Instance even if for whatever reason connection with the global network would be broken. As an additional benefit, using the external token with OurWorld would go faster and would not need the extreme energy needed for tokens like Bitcoin (today 100USD worth of energy per transaction).</p>
<p>The DEFI system is also the liquidity pool and treasury (initial funding) for each OurWorld Internet.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-reliable"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-reliable">The Internet of Internets is Reliable</a></h2>
<p>Each Regional Internet is ultra reliable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data can never be lost nor corrupted.</li>
<li>Internet lines can be cut, even if all public Internet connections would go down, the local instance would still function, allowing financial transactions to happen and information to be consulted as the data is local and safe.</li>
<li>The distributed nature of the Internet of Internets is even war-safe, a disaster or war situation has no impact on the reliability of the internet (if a large enough distribution is achieved)</li>
<li>All systems are local and sovereign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because it's an effort by the people for the people it has, by design, more support and so it can grow without limits.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-opensource"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-opensource">The Internet of Internets is OpenSource</a></h2>
<p>All components inside the system are open source and all of the code and knowledge required is delivered as part of the local deployment. As a result, every community can contribute to and co-create our future.</p>
<p>It's a platform created by all of us for everyone. There is a 100% decentralized code management system integrated to allow this to happen.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-complete"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-complete">The Internet of Internets is Complete</a></h2>
<p>There are tens of incredible experiences ready to go. <br />
The Following Experiences are deployed in each OurWorld Instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sikana (education system with lots of content, +4billion views today)</li>
<li>Uhuru (alternative to Office 365 or Google Docs/Drive)</li>
<li>Alternative to twitter, whatsapp, facebook, … </li>
<li>The resources and materials needed to deploy such an internet (manuals, ebooks and videos)</li>
<li>Full set of information
<ul>
<li>We are executing on a huge effort to download and categorize +40 Petabytes of information from the existing internet, this information will be available in each OurWorld Instance. We will make sure that all this information is protected and available to everyone in the world independent of what is happening or what will happen.</li>
<li>It's an endless stream of information (maps, educational content, source code, knowledge, ebooks, …).</li>
</ul>

<p>On the security side, the Internet is super centralized today and actually very vulnerable. The Cyber Pandemic is a reality.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="internet-bandwidth-problem"><a class="header" href="#internet-bandwidth-problem">Internet Bandwidth problem</a></h1>
<p>The internet is not optimized, most data should stay local but it actually travels very far away.</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/internet_distance.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<h2 id="status-quo"><a class="header" href="#status-quo">Status Quo</a></h2>
<p>When two individuals in Zanzibar want to communicate, for example over a zoom call, their transmitted data must follow an incredibly lengthy and expensive journey; </p>
<ul>
<li>the message must travel to the central Zanzibar internet exchange</li>
<li>it then crosses in one of two sea cables to mainland Tanzania</li>
<li>the message undergoes a very long journey to a European or American internet exchange</li>
<li>in Europe, the message is routed to Zoom's datacentre where it is processed.</li>
<li>Finally, the message is sent back along the entire route to the second person</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This situation is not sustainable!</strong></p>
<p>There are five primary issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must travel over such a long distance, increasing transmission times and increasing the energy consumption of the infrastructure along the route.</li>
<li>Crucial bandwidth with the rest of the world is used up, meaning that critical communication is delayed for unreasonably long periods of time. </li>
<li>Data is not owned by Zanzibar or its people; it is owned by multinational corporations in the West.</li>
<li>If those two undersea cables digitally connecting Zanzibar to the rest of the world were ever damaged, the entire internet within Zanzibar would fail as well. Two residents would no longer be able to communicate with each other over the internet.</li>
<li>Transmitted data is far less secure and has a far greater attack surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threefold-alternative"><a class="header" href="#threefold-alternative">Threefold Alternative</a></h2>
<p>We present an alternative solution in which data remains within zanzibar and we avoid all of the issues above. The journey will be massively simplified; the first individual interacts with their twin to send a message to the second individual's twin, where it is immediately accessible.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-internet-today"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-today">The Internet Today</a></h2>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/today_internet.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>The internet today is constructed in a centralized way, we exist many times and became a product of big centralized corporations. There is also a real cyber pandemic going on; there are cyber attacks everywhere and backdoors in most of the electronic equipment we use. This architecture is unsafe, not scalable, power hungry and unable to deliver equality. Still, more than half of our planet does not have decent affordable access to the internet.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is a huge step in the right direction but it's a shared architecture distributed over the world where data gets replicated in many locations. It is a good technology choice for use-cases like money, smart contracts, voting, digital notary services and identity management but not at all suited for building a new internet. This is also called web4. Developers still need to develop applications connecting to multiple blockchains and centralization is often not good enough.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="web-re-made-architecture"><a class="header" href="#web-re-made-architecture">Web Re-Made Architecture</a></h2>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/web_remade_architecture.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>We are brainwashed about the need to centralize and control everything. As such, we produce suboptimal systems and a lot of waste. Web 1,2 are all centralized by nature. The best the world has been able to come up with is a shared consensus driven architecture called blockchain which is good for certain use cases but suboptimal for many more. </p>
<p>The solution is actually very simple, you should be the center of your digital life, you own all your data; you are your own application (we call this your digital twin), we believe +90% of your digital needs can be implemented that way. Blockchain technology is needed for items where consensus is required like identity, money, smart contracts…</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/twin_infrastructure.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>There is a need for a co-owned global Internet infrastructure on top of which each of us can exist digitally, this is a dramatically different architecture with no centralization whatsoever and offering 100% equality as well as full data and application ownership. This has never been done because it's so different in design and is incompatible with big money-making corporations maintaining control.</p>
<p>The twins live on top of the ThreeFold Grid which is a co-owned infrastructure layer where every Internet Farmer makes money by providing storage, compute and network capacity to the people around them.</p>
<p>The twins communicate with each other and the rest of the world (existing centralized services) as well as existing blockchain technologies. The twin data uses a novel storage technology which makes sure your data is safe and can never get lost, yet it's only owned by you and not even a quantum computer can hack it.</p>

<p>There are three critical issues that we have identified in the current internet that we believe must be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a cyberpandemic going on, with cyber crime growing exponentially.</li>
<li>For many countries, the internet is GDP negative and controlled by foriegn powers.</li>
<li>The proposed solution of Central Bank Digital Currencies is actually flawed and must be carefully managed.</li>

<p><img src="solutions/img/cybersecurity_trillion.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Countries have a hard time defending themselves against cyber security threats; the main issue is that the technology available to them often comes from compromised sources. Where better to put backdoors than in the tools which should defend you? As such, we now have an IT infrastructure which is rife with issues and which is incredibly difficult to make secure.</p>
<p>EXISTING SOLUTIONS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND OUTDATED.
A NEW APPROACH IS NEEDED.</p>

<h3 id="data-privacy--sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#data-privacy--sovereignty">Data Privacy &amp; Sovereignty</a></h3>
<p>Almost all data of a country's internet users is not hosted on that country's soil. This leads to a loss of sovereignity and poses serious data risks to the citizens of your country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who’s ever cleared a browser history feels like technology throws us back at ourselves. My Google data, combined with my bank card transactions, social media messages, health records, and more, could tell you more about me than I could. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Most of us don’t have the time or energy to keep track of all the data we’re shedding online, or read all the terms and conditions when downloading an app. (Ten years ago, two researchers at Carnegie Mellon found it would take the average internet user 25 days per year to read every privacy policy on every website they visited. Today, that number will only have increased) We are now in a position where we have to trust that regulators and industry leaders are keeping us safe.</em></p>
<p><em>But policy makers are struggling to keep up with the pace of technological advances. The number of devices collecting and analyzing information in real time, otherwise known as the internet of things, is expected to exceed 50 billion by 2020.</em></p>
<p><em>Recent, high-profile data breaches, such as Uber’s loss of 57 million users’ information, and political firm Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of Facebook data relating to nearly 90 million users, show even when we think we’re being careful online, we’re not always safe from harm.</em></p>
<h3 id="for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative"><a class="header" href="#for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative">For Most Countries The Internet is GDP Negative</a></h3>
<p>Internet DATA is more important than voice (minutes) these days, the main communication of the future is through data, new regulations and technical guidelines are required to secure this future trend.</p>
<p>Most of the revenue related to internet and telecommunications services does not stay in your country and as such the internet is GDP negative. We believe that by means of practical technology and regulatory guidelines, this trend can be reversed. The value of a digital life in the US is thousands of USD per year per person; imagine the potential for your country.</p>

<p><img src="solutions/img/centralized_dc_issues.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Too few individuals control access to the internet, leading to unjust pricing and security risks. It's too easy for hackers to focus on the few parties delivering access to the rest of us. More decentralization will lead to more security and fairer chances for everyone involved. Ledger (blockchain) technology can be used to decentralize internet access yet still give full insight to the country's government in relation to billing &amp; utilization statistics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CBDC = Central Bank Digital Currencies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CBDC’s are an incredibly exciting possible innovation for a country. But, we realize that there are serious challenges and requirements not met in relation to sovereignty, security, and scalability in many of the current project proposals.</p>
<p>This is not only for CBDC’s, but blockchain technology in general.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that this does not happen for your country. We want to make sure your country maintains control over your money supply. Right now, in some deployments, we see that this is a real risk and countries could lose control to other countries or hackers.</p>
<p>Buying into a technology from a vendor which does not apply to following requirements is discouraged</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of the blockchain needs to be in the country (nodes, technology, knowledge, …)</li>
<li>The source code of the blockchain technology needs to be understood by engineers and developers living and working in your country and working for a trusted entity (or more than one)</li>
<li>The blockchain technology needs to be truly decentralized
<ul>
<li>e.g. the coders should not be able to change the blockchain operation (right now most tech companies can change their blockchains by changing the code)</li>
<li>The validator nodes cannot be hosted in datacenters out of the country or be owned by too few parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It needs to be verified that there are no backdoors in the blockchain technology.</li>
<li>Blockchain needs to be scalable enough</li>
<li>Even if internet backbone connections go down (e.g. between the country and the rest of the world), the blockchain should keep on working.</li>
<li>Blockchain should be energy efficient and not based on burning fossil fuels or, more generally, high energy consumption.</li>
<li>There need to be procedures to allow the legal system of your country to interfere in case serious issues arise.</li>
<li>There needs to be a mechanism for people to manage their identity and private keys with more user friendliness (today it's too complicated and too dangerous).</li>
<li>Running blockchain permissioned (which means managed by people in centralized datacenters) might bring the risk of running a money chain related to a couple of people who need to be trusted, this might even be less regulated than in a typical central banking environment.</li>

<p>A private intranet digital backbone built with a very different approach can solve the wave of cybercrime that the internet is experiencing today.</p>
<p><strong>This multi-trillion USD problem</strong> will not go away by itself. we have a multitude of technology solutions at our disposal which are able to provide a real antidote for the cyberpandemic. This antidote is not a &quot;layered on&quot; painkiller quick fix, but a from-the-ground-up re-engineered, effective and breakthrough solution.</p>
<h3 id="some-possibilities"><a class="header" href="#some-possibilities">Some possibilities:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A liquid cooled, edge distributed, decentralized network of small datacenter nodes (they can be in basements or other hidden locations). Through decentralization, we can achieve the redundacy necessary to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. </li>
<li>Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. This is also an ultra scalable system.</li>
<li>A country-owned multilayer network communication encryption system for the government and other collaborators.</li>
<li>Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox the access and hosting of these apps.</li>
<li>Use blockchain technology (BUT within the country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, which do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or controlled too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for CBDCs.</li>
<li>Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).</li>
</ul>
<p>### The more expensive solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in the harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). This secondary network would be compatible with 4G devices, where only authorized people can gain access, End2End encrypted and not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints mean extreme resilience to all attacks and disasters.</li>
<li>Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut into chunks of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.</li>
<li>A communication mechanism which does not use TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA-based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams within the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have are less probable and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. This is expensive though but, in our opinion, worth it. This fulfils the crucial need for sovereignty.</li>
<li>All critical software used should be owned by local experts within the country and it all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to minimise backdoors and to keep things simple and integrated.</li>
<li>Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.</li>
<li>All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly should occur within the country.</li>

<p>Web 4 is a new concept which is the combination of Web 3 (blockchain) and digital twin technology.</p>
<p>Its a concept with many advantages like</p>
<ul>
<li>less power usage</li>
<li>more scalability</li>
<li>more flexibility</li>
<li>faster development</li>
<li>more security</li>

<p><strong>Example deployment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lots of locations (offices, banks, small datacenters, universities, ...), each providing compute &amp; storage to a private and/or public grid by means of the 3Nodes</li>
<li>Each node runs Zero-OS which has no shell and cannot be accessed by any person in the organization (bank, government, enterprise)</li>
<li>None of the nodes has enough data to allow anyone to reconstruct the data</li>
<li>The different nodes together deliver a super resilient network of compute &amp; network resources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Even if, in a disaster scenario, 30% of the locations would go down, the system would still function and be available to its users. This is the most reliable deployment possible in IT landscape today.</strong></p>
<p>What runs on the 3Nodes</p>

<li>Blockchain Nodes</li>
<li>The distributed storage system (ultra safe, zero-knowledge proof)</li>
<li>Digital Twins for users</li>
<li>Secure Browser Engines (can be in ultra safe location)</li>

<p>We use VLANG for</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital twin backend (the main language for our digital life)</li>
<li>Provisioning language for Threefold Grid (in progress)</li>
<li>Language integrated with our chosen blockchain Algorand (we are close to having a full VLang compatible SDK for Algorand as well as VTeal smart contract language, this will be the easiest way to integrate and develop on top of Algorand)</li>
<li>Dynamic Executor Language (fastest way to develop peer2peer on top of ThreeFold Grid).</li>

<p>This Dynamic Executor Language is used in 
* Digital Twin
* BCDB = BlockChain Database
* ThreeFold Grid Executors (serverless functions &amp; compatibility layer for old internet)</p>

<p><img src="web4/finance/img/cryptocurrency.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>In Addition to allowing a user to directly integrate with an outside digital currency, we also suggest allowing wrapping of the outside currencies e.g. a wrapped BitCoin (BTC).</p>
<p>This Wrapped BTC is then stored on the main or dedicated digital currency chain (can even be one chain per wrapped asset). The IBC (see below) allows the wrapped BTC to be used by the user from their wallet and digital twin.</p>
<p>The Original BTC is stored offline in the Knox Security Vault using our Quantum Safe Storage Codec. This allows for ultimate security and flexibility for users.</p>
<p>The bank can choose to allow users to exchange digital currencies with the external world or not, through IBC (Inter Blockchain Protocol, see below), this can be easily achieved. The bank can even choose to become a liquidity provider for the existing digital currency world (optional).</p>
<p>Revolut, for example, has chosen to keep the digital currencies in their internal system, and the user can only exchange from their own fiat currency to the digital currency and back. We believe though that it's nicer to allow the user to exchange digital currencies with the outside world if it matches the Bank’s Regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>It is possible to introduce multiple stages e.g. in the digital bank ecosystem, users can freely exchange currencies with each other (stays on chain). Once they want to go off chain, extra checks are done to make sure there is no fraud involved, it can then take a certain time before it executes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="peer2peer-reputation-system"><a class="header" href="#peer2peer-reputation-system">Peer2Peer Reputation System</a></h1>
<p>Reputation is a very important part to any financial system. This allows users to see the reputation of the people they are transacting or doing business with.</p>
<p>We are developing a unique peer2peer reputation system to allow the power of network effects to come up with strong verification and reputation proofs. We think this might become an important added value that any financial institution  government could deliver to its customers/citizens.</p>
<p>Such a system can easily be integrated and extended by a standard KYC and AML system.</p>
<p>This goes had in had with the Proof of Authenticity system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="proof-of-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#proof-of-authenticity">Proof of Authenticity</a></h1>
<p>Proof of Authenticity (PoA) is an algorithm that allows peers to verify that people, products and statements on the ThreeFold Grid are genuine. It acts as a reputation engine to validate any information on the grid. </p>
<h2 id="why-proof-of-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#why-proof-of-authenticity">Why Proof of Authenticity</a></h2>
<p>Any system that contains a vast amount of information, should require proof of authenticity.</p>
<p>We believe users should be able to measure authenticity in relation to</p>
<ul>
<li>The people they connect with;</li>
<li>The products and services they access;</li>
<li>The information they consume.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, to automate information search in a decentralized and trustful environemnt, an algorithm that is able to scale information verification in a neutral way is required. </p>
<p>Proof of authenticity puts forward a very simple method to verify the genuiness of information.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how PoA works in a decentralized context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone fills in their profile with their personal and professional data. </li>
<li>A former colleague finds their information and verifies their information as being authentic. </li>
<li>Once a user gets verified e.g. 10 times, they can be trusted to be real and genuine. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above can also apply to products, statements and more. In that sense, PoA can solve multiple digital challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The verifiability of information and news </li>
<li>A non-biased way to rate products and services. </li>
<li>website authenticity </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applicability"><a class="header" href="#applicability">Applicability</a></h2>
<p>POA can be used for any type of information but one of the first ones is identity, KYC/AML is a mechanism to identify people but peer authentication is a very powerful way to extend this with.</p>

<p>Thanks to the digital twin this is implemented in a fully peer2peer way, while using DeFi Smart Contracts on the blockchain.</p>

<p><img src="web4/finance/img/distributed_storage.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Each Knox Security Vault is an ultra safe area. Thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage system, it is not possible to retrieve a key even if a hacker would be in one safe, as a combination of three safes is required to recover information.</p>
<p>We suggest using the key storage in the following way: each wallet from a user stores the encrypted dispersed key distributed over four or five Knox Security Vaults. Only in the case of a disaster and user strong identification, an user could get access (in the case of death of the customer, to hand-over to the relatives).</p>

<p><img src="web4/security/img/browser_firewall.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>For ultra secure use cases, the user doesn't use javascript in his browser, he connects over an ultra secure end2end encrypted and multi authenticated link from his browser to a secure location. In the secure location, the secure browser engine gives access to the required web and banking applications which connect further.</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/twin_functions.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>As an option, the web sessions can be recorded for auditing or anti-hacking/fraud detection, also in a secure location.</p>
<p>The twin can communicate with other twins, in a close ultra secure context, giving no chance to hackers to interfere. The data is stored on a Quantum Safe Storage system (see further).</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/cyber_security.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>This leads to very good protection and ‘Auditing’ opportunities.</p>
<p>Cyber crime will have a much harder time to be successful, way more difficult (we hope impossible).</p>
<p>Even in the very unlikely event a hacker would succeed, he would only interfere with one twin, which means only one customer would be affected!!!  This makes it so much harder for hackers to deploy capital to hack and social engineer their way into a secure environment.</p>

<p>We are digitally sovereign:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am me, I am sovereign</li>

<li>Everything I produce is owned by me, and stored by my twin on locations my twin and me know about.</li>
<li>Because the capabilities are owned by me, they can easily be extended and I can use them everywhere, it makes my life easier, I don't have to learn different tools each time I enter another event</li>

<p>Every person owns a Digital Twin, which is your personal Internet Gateway Application. This Digital Twin (also called Freeflow Twin) is running on a location of your choice. Each twin is owned by only one owner. The Twin has lots of capabilities and serves its owner 24h a day, 7/7. Experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin.</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/intro_twin_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A twin owns your data and your identity. All data is stored in such a way it can never be corrupted or lost. You own your data, your identity and your digital skills for all your life.</p>
<p>And when you die you can handover your digital heritage to your beloved ones.</p>
<p>Each Twin has following capabilities:</p>

<p>Lets make a comparison of how our digital systems work in relation to how we do things in day to day life, in this case we are comparing with an educational event.</p>
<p>We hope you will see how current web experiences are and not logical, they are designed to lock us in ,and treat us like their product rather than being only at our service.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-2-way--the-current-internet"><a class="header" href="#the-web-2-way--the-current-internet">The Web 2 way = the current internet.</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to an educational event, it is very affordable, maybe even free</li>
<li>They ask me to change clothes and use theirs, so we all look alike</li>
<li>I am not allowed to bring or use my own tools. They give me theirs, a pen, headset, glasses, and a notebook, which I am asked to return at the end</li>
<li>The event creators keep my freedom limited and overwhelm me with audio/video experience, if I am allowed to chose, it is all based on their scripts</li>
<li>They drive me around from activity to activity in the experience, its all very well done and impressive</li>
<li>They track everything I do, to make sure they can adjust the experience to have me even more impressed next time, because they want me to come back</li>
<li>If I take notes it is in their notebook, but I can't take it with me, if they destroy it its gone</li>
<li>I am happy, because it's all incredible and very well done</li>
<li>I take the commercial content for granted because yeh, you know I got this for a low cost, they need to make money too</li>
<li>If I want to get back to the content of the event, I need to pay again and go through the event again</li>
<li>If I would go to another (similar) event from another provider, I would have to restart from scratch, I would have to get other tools, another notebook, I cannot reuse what I have produced on the first event.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the good thing is, I don't have to think that much and it is very addictive, they learn very well what we like and keep on improving constantly, so we want to come back.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-3-way"><a class="header" href="#the-web-3-way">The Web 3 way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All as above, but the event is not owned by a company but by all of us</li>
<li>We have a vote in how the event should be created</li>
<li>It is at least better because if, working properly, it iss a consensus owned experience</li>
<li>Now at least we have the feeling we co-own how the event is being created</li>
<li>We will realize its all very hard to run a real democracy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-freeflow-way"><a class="header" href="#the-freeflow-way">The FreeFlow Way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to the education event</li>
<li>They check if the tools I have are up-to-date for the experience they have created. If not they tell me where I can get new tools (upgrade them), but they remain mine. These tools are my core digital capabilities or skills,</li>
<li>I can now go into the event and experience 'the experience' as prepared for me, I walk freely around, I take notes on my notebook, so I can use it later,</li>
<li>I have a lot of freedom where to go, and what to do first,</li>
<li>I can use many more of my capabilities, I don't have to learn new ways to do something, because the tools (capabilities) are mine. I can dance, sing, run, jump, ...</li>
<li>I will be able to do things the creators of the event did not foresee, there is so much joy and freedom, I am creative and I am alive,</li>
<li>Its easier to make friends, because I can bring my friends in a much easier way, because they already have the required capabilities,</li>
<li>I can give authenticity to the experience, my feedback matters from out of my own power,</li>
<li>It might be I have to think and act more myself, I am using my tools (capabilities) in the incredible experience as created by the education event organizers,</li>
<li>I will be super happy because I feel empowered, I am less addicted maybe because I am less controlled, but I know whatever I learned is for me to keep, I feel productive because I am allowed to use my capabilities, and my data was enriched by me..</li>

<p>Private version of the chat:</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/skills/extra/img/chat_overview.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The chat communication tools presents a simple interface to manage both individuals and group messaging. The interface presented is very similar to mainstream messaging platforms but works in a very different way.</p>
<p>Centralized messaging services always have a third party (company) involved.  A message would follow the following path:</p>
<h2 id="chat-architecture"><a class="header" href="#chat-architecture">Chat Architecture</a></h2>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    subgraph Individual A;
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALA --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA;
    subgraph Messaging provider;
    MESSAGINGA(messaging platform);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    subgraph Individual B;
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB;
    end;
</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the messaging provider sits in the middle and has access to all messages passing through its messaging platform. It means that messaging providers can (or can be told to) do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do machine learning on message content and/or message volume, frequency, size and all sort of other data</li>
<li>expose, compile and sell machine learning outcome (metadata)</li>
<li>provide access to meta data or actual messaging information to other companies or governing bodies</li>
<li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous documentaries and news stories out there that prove that this is the case. A decentralized messaging platform avoids all of this.</p>
<p>Decentralized messaging send and receive messages from private messaging instances to the receiving party's private (messaging) instance. It doesn't have a central man in the middle. There are two main types of decentralized messaging in this capability:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>private chat</em>: private entity to private entity</li>
<li><em>group chat</em>: one private entity creates and <strong>hosts</strong> the &quot;group&quot;, and all the other members are invited to post and receive message from this group. The entity that starts the group also sets the groups &quot;rules&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-chat"><a class="header" href="#private-chat">Private Chat</a></h3>
<p>With private chat we mean a chat between two entities. These entities could be individuals, organizations, companies, clubs, basically anything.  The chat is a one to one chat, and information (data) is exchanged between two private, secure and personal messaging platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>a chat starts with inviting the other persons twin (messaging and other services platform ), in this case the twin of the other person needs to be found and sent an invite message.</li>
<li>if the person accepts the invite, a secure connection allows messages to be send person to person without a third party in the middle. Only the (twins of) two people involved have access to he message data (metadata).</li>
</ul>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR

    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|Browser| TWINB
    TWINB --&gt;|secure network| TWINA
    end
</pre>
<p>The chat functionality allows most (if not all) of the standard functionalities known from many centralized platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>send text message</li>
<li>send voice message</li>
<li>message reply</li>
<li>message forward</li>
<li>send photo/file/</li>
</ul>
<p>From the chat function you can also initiate video conference, and have control over accepting, deleting and blocking users.</p>
<h3 id="group-chat"><a class="header" href="#group-chat">Group Chat</a></h3>
<p>Group chat is unique to this peer2peer chat platform. The group functionality is initiated by the group creator and this action creates the group function on the initiators' messaging platform (twin). The group is then formed by inviting other entities and when they accept they get 'read and write' access in the group messaging functionality.</p>

<p>A truly peer2peer video chat experience starting from your digital twin to your guests', without stopping by a data center in between. Of course, free.</p>
<p>Current world video conferencing services use service provider and centralized software installations to present services to businesses and consumers. Take for example two users in Zanzibar who wish to communicate through zoom (or google meet, or Microsoft Teams, principle stays the same), they will connect from their laptops/phones to a centralized service, and the traffic will be routed from both of their devices to a centralized service datacenter far away.</p>
<p>In principle this looks like</p>

<p>Browsing the internet present risks. There are many sites which have malicious codes embedded in what look like harmless web pages. These malicious contents get uploaded to your browser and might trick you in agreeing malicious codes in your local browser or you local machine. This is a fairly common practice and people are being tricked into providing information of access to others which they should not.</p>
<p>The Surf Safe option of the twin provides a virtual browser on the twin that browses the internet on behalf off the person who operates the twin.</p>

<p>Lacking the tools to enable effective and sustainable
collaboration and sharing between children, teachers and the school.</p>
<p>Traditional marketplaces use money to measure the exchange of values and resources. However, money cannot be used as recognition for the children’s contributions in the school.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying our gratitude points as recognition for their contributions and positive exchanges enabled a remarkable impact and flow of values.
Children, teachers and parents support each other, their school and staff resulting in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift from passive listeners to mutual learning through peer-to-peer teaching</li>
<li>Kids extend their real life capabilities by practicing new skills</li>
<li>Kids are significantly more engaged and happy</li>
<li>Increased capacity of the school to effectively handle its objectives</li>

<h2 id="usecase-3--social-delivery"><a class="header" href="#usecase-3--social-delivery">Usecase 3:  Social Delivery</a></h2>
<p><strong>Enterprises to NGOs</strong></p>
<p>Large businesses are storing unimaginable excess inventory of goods.</p>
<p>Goods that were returned by customers, didn’t sell during the season or simply finished their use even though they are still in great condition.</p>
<p>Those resources are stuck, expensive to store, or dumped and no one benefits from it.</p>
<p>Flow of enterprises’ excess capacity becomes an income for NGOs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive the valuable goods (in-kind donations)</li>
<li>Upload the goods to the Social Delivery (“SD”) marketplace</li>
<li>Distribute points to the approved NGOs as a monthly budget</li>
<li>NGOs shop in the SD marketplace for things they really need at the time needed NGOs 1. exchange their points for chosen merchandises and equipment</li>
<li>NGOs distribute these items to the communities they support</li>
<li>NGOs saves significant amount of money</li>
<li>Saved money enable the NGOs to better deliver on their core mission</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tax credits for “in-kind donations” motivate enterprises to further participate and benefit for doing good out of zero value inventory that cost them money to store or eliminate.</em></p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying Floweavers resulted in a win-win-situation both for the enterprises and the NGOs. The capacities and inventories that were stuck at the enterprises were donated and uploaded to the market place and became very useful for the NGOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating NGOs received a monthly budget of $2,156 - $10,385 in points</li>
<li>With this budget of points the NGOs could order online items that they needed</li>
<li>NGOs were enabled to also offer help (and not just get donations)</li>
<li>Keep their fiat money to better fulfill their core mission</li>
<li>Businesses linked their in-kind donations towards their corporate responsibility.</li>

<p>Use case of a Peer2Peer community shipping:</p>
<p>Betty needed to pick up an item from a member, on the way back home she delivered an item to another member who lives near her, and gained additional points for it. The way it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betty is scheduled to meet Lee to pick up an item</li>
<li>Lee asked Betty if she can also take another item for someone that lives next to her</li>
<li>Betty agreed and picked up two items: one for herself, one for another member -Rachel</li>
<li>Rachel contacted Betty to schedule a pickup time to get the item</li>
<li>Rachel rewarded Betty with points for delivering the item closer to her home.</li>

<p><img src="mytwin/experiences/sikana/img/sikana_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Education is a sector that still relies on traditional teaching methods, a teacher, a classroom, a black (or white) board, books, paper and pencils. This method has been in use for hundreds of years. In the current digital age, the classroom can be a digital classroom, with a teacher teaching while all of the rest of the required items can be digitised.</p>
<p>Traditional learning is based on a live teacher, teaching an audience in a classroom. This works, however it has a number of restrictions which makes that work for a limited number of pupils, and not everywhere, because of the necessity to have live teachers and pupils. In this digital world we can record and present the learning materials in a digital manner to a much larger audience than a single classroom.  Classes, or better as curriculum can be digitised and shared along a much larger group of pupils spanning a vast geographic area.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has proven that remote teaching is possible and that the current technology allow for this. This experience was still based on the standard teacher - pupil relationship and numbers for live teaching. Another technology, a video sharing platform has proven that storing videos and sharing videos is a effective manner to reach a very large number of viewers (youtube.com).</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/experiences/sikana/img/sikana2_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Taking the learnings from both of these current use cases, we have created Sikana. Improve your life - one skill at a time. Sikana is a free education platform, with more than 4 billion views, aiming to deliver quality education and necessary skills to everyone. The software can be installed on threefold nodes and deployed regionally so that bandwidth requirements are minimised because it is a decentralized online education platform.</p>

<p>To scale such a solution for many classrooms in many schools and in many different regions put enormous requirements and stress on the central video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Decentralized video sharing as an education platform will lower the requirements on the education / video sharing platform and creates, stores and distributes educational content from within a region, or even from within a school. This brings a solution to educate everywhere, even if there is no internet connection. A simple Wifi router that connects devices to the educational platform is all that is needed.</p>

<p>State of the art rendering and experiences beyond e-commerce and marketing. A metaverse built by and for the people using it, with worthwhile capabilities that enhance your virtual experience. </p>
<p>A high quality metaverse experience cannot be delivered from far away datacenters, just like a very high resolution and action intense games cannot be delivered by central large datacenters.  Local gaming consoles are top of the market and present the best gaming experience to gamers. Gaming consoles are local to gamers for optimum performance and experience. For immersive metaverse high quality and responsive metaverse experiences you need local data compute, storage and GPU rendering.</p>
<h3 id="local-gpu-rendering"><a class="header" href="#local-gpu-rendering">Local GPU Rendering</a></h3>
<p>OurVerse’s proximity of ThreeFold’s edge computing allows rendering proximity (low latency) and speed unmatched in the industry.</p>
<p>This allows streaming and graphic rendering at super high speeds with pixel perfect imagery, making OurVerse the first metaverse to achieve this status.</p>
<p>Even on mobile devices, GPU rendering shows quality previously not available for such experiences.</p>
<h2 id="metaverse-is-making-remote-local"><a class="header" href="#metaverse-is-making-remote-local">Metaverse is making remote local</a></h2>
<p>The metaverse allows to create physical world experiences and in general things we are used to available in the digital space.  We do so much in our personal and professional lives online that is replaces a lot of physical times being with others.  In order to make that digital online life more like our day to day physical life.  Email, Todo lists, video conferences they can all be redone and redesigned into something that is more personal and provides everyone with more detailed input and feedback about the situation we are in.</p>
<h2 id="example-experiences"><a class="header" href="#example-experiences">Example experiences</a></h2>
<h3 id="personal-todo-list"><a class="header" href="#personal-todo-list">Personal ToDo list</a></h3>
<p>The metaverse presents real work experiences in a new an innovative way.  For example a wall with ToDo list functionality will present different personal ToDo lists for any that is looking at the same wall. Also, when two people want to share their todo lists they can make their private todo list viewable for other digital avatars in the digital space.

<p>Covid-19 has put digital meetings in everyones agenda. From business meetings to school classes, we all have been using industry standard video conferencing tools.  This is a step forward from having audio conferences only, but a lot can be improved if all participants are part of and in a virtual space where everyone has 3D virtual representation, and experiences the same (virtual) environment as one would in the real world in a conference room.</p>
<p>This is possible in the metaverse, and proximity of the virtual world rendering makes the experiences high quality and latency free.

<p>ThreeFold has developed a highly efficient infrastructure layer for a new internet.</p>
<p>ThreeFold tech stack has 4 main layers</p>
<ul>
<li>compute - a flexible way to deploy any workload on edge cloud computers</li>
<li>storage - a quantum safe storage system</li>
<li>network - a planetary scalable overlay network</li>
<li>blockchain for Smart Contract For IT</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="technology/img/tech_overview2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A lot of capacity has been deployed in the world, ThreeFold farmers buy a computer and they connect it to the internet, as such they use our Operating system to provide Internet capacity to the world.</p>
<p><img src="technology/img/3node_simple.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are multiple ways how people can interactive without our platform (as developer or IT expert = sysadmin):</p>
<p><img src="technology/img/architecture_usage.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>All technology is developed by ThreeFold and is opensource, this technology is being used for the ThreeFold grid see https://www.threefold.io which is a deployment of a new internet which is green, safe and owned by all of us.</p>
<p>This document explains how we are a missing layer for the full web2, web3 and blockchain world.</p>
<p>This leads to a system which is highly scalable.</p>

<h3 id="zero-os"><a class="header" href="#zero-os">Zero-OS</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold has build its own operating system called Zero-OS, which was based starting from a Linux Kernel with as purpose to remove all the unnecessary complexities found on contemporary OS's. </p>
<p>Zero-OS supports a small number of primitives, and performs low-level functions natively. </p>
<p>It delivers 3 primitive functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>storage capacity</li>
<li>compute capacity </li>
<li>network capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no shell, local nor remote attached to Zero-OS. It does not allow for inbound network connections to happen to the core. Also, given its shell-less nature, the people and organizations, called farmers, that run 3nodes cannot issue any commands nor access its features. In that sense, Zero-OS enables a &quot;zero people&quot; (autonomous) Internet, meaning hackers cannot get in, while also eliminating human error from the paradigm. </p>
<h3 id="3node"><a class="header" href="#3node">3Node</a></h3>
<p>The ThreeFold_Grid needs hardware/servers to function. Servers of all shapes and sizes can be added to the grid by anyone, anywhere in the world. The production of Internet Capacity on the Threefold Grid is called Farming and people who add these servers to the grid are called Farmers. This is a fully decentralized process and they get rewarded by the means of TFT. </p>
<p>Farmers download the Zero-OS operating system and boot their servers themselves. Once booted, these servers become 3Nodes. The 3Nodes will register themselves in a database called the TF Explorer. Once registered in the TF Explorer, the capacity of the 3Nodes will become available on the TF Grid Explorer. Also, given the autonomous nature of the ThreeFold Grid, there is no need for any intermediaries between the user and 3Nodes. </p>
<p>This enables a complete peer2peer environment for people to reserve their Internet Capacity directly from the hardware.</p>
<h3 id="smart-contract-for-it"><a class="header" href="#smart-contract-for-it">Smart Contract for IT</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the smart contract for IT is to create and enable autonomous IT. Autonomous self-driving IT is possible.</p>
<p>Once a smart contract for IT is created, it will be registered in the TFChain Blockchain.</p>

<h3 id="tfchain"><a class="header" href="#tfchain">TFChain</a></h3>
<p>A blockchain running on the TFGrid stores the following information (TFGrid 3.0)</p>
<ul>
<li>registry for all digital twins (identity system, aka phonebook)</li>
<li>registry for all farmers &amp; 3nodes</li>
<li>registry for our reputation system</li>
<li>info as required for the Smart Contract for IT</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the hart of our operational system of the TFGrid</p>
<h3 id="peer-to-peer-network"><a class="header" href="#peer-to-peer-network">Peer-to-Peer Network</a></h3>
<p>The peer2peer network allows any zmachine or user to connect with other zmachine or users on the TF Grid securely, and creates a private shortest path peer2peer network. </p>
<h3 id="web-gateway"><a class="header" href="#web-gateway">Web Gateway</a></h3>
<p>The Web Gateway is a mechanism to connect the private (overlay) networks to the open Internet. By not providing an open and direct path in to the private network, a lot of malicious phishing and hacking attempts are stopped at the Web Gateway level for container applications. </p>

<p>Our storage architecture follows the true peer2peer design of the TF grid.

<h2 id="mount-any-files-in-your-storage-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#mount-any-files-in-your-storage-infrastructure">Mount Any Files in your Storage Infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>The QSFS is a mechanism to mount any file system (in any format) on the grid, in a quantum-secure way. </p>
<p>This storage layer relies on 3 primitives of the ThreeFold technology : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db">0-db</a> is the storage engine.
It is an always append database, which stores objects in an immutable format. It allows keeping the history out-of-the-box, good performance on disk, low overhead, easy data structure and easy backup (linear copy and immutable files).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-stor_v2">0-stor-v2</a> is used to disperse the data into chunks by performing 'forward-looking error-correcting code' (FLECC) on it and send the fragments to safe locations.
It takes files in any format as input, encrypts the file with AES based on a user-defined key, then FLECC-encodes the file and spreads out the result
to multiple 0-DBs. The number of generated chunks is configurable to make it more or less robust against data loss through unavailable fragments. Even if some 0-DBs are unreachable, you can still retrieve the original data, and missing 0-DBs can even be rebuilt to have full consistency. It's an essential element of the operational backup. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db-fs">0-db-fs</a> is the filesystem driver which uses 0-DB as a primary storage engine. It manages the storage of directories and metadata in a dedicated namespace and file payloads in another dedicated namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they form a storage layer that is quantum secure: even the most powerful computer can't hack the system because no single node contains all of the information needed to reconstruct the data.</p>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/quantum_safe_storage.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This concept scales forever, and you can bring any file system on top of it: </p>
<ul>
<li>S3 storage </li>
<li>any backup system</li>
<li>an ftp-server</li>
<li>IPFS and Hypercore distributed file sharing protocols </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/qss_scaleout.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Quantum Safe Storage Algorithm is the heart of the Storage engine. The storage engine takes the original data objects and creates data part descriptions that it stores over many virtual storage devices (ZDB/s)</p>
<p>Data gets stored over multiple ZDB's in such a way that data can never be lost.</p>
<p>Unique features</p>
<ul>
<li>data always append, can never be lost</li>
<li>even a quantum computer cannot decrypt the data</li>
<li>is spread over multiple sites, sites can be lost, data will still be available</li>
<li>protects for datarot.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why</a></h3>
<p>Today we produce more data than ever before. We could not continue to make full copies of data to make sure it is stored reliably. This will simply not scale. We need to move from securing the whole dataset to securing all the objects that make up a dataset.</p>
<p>ThreeFold is using space technology to store data (fragments) over multiple devices (physical storage devices in 3Nodes). The solution does not distribute and store parts of an object (file, photo, movie...) but describes the part of an object. This could be visualized by thinking of it as equations.</p>
<h3 id="details"><a class="header" href="#details">Details</a></h3>
<p>Let a,b,c,d.... be the parts of that original object. You could create endless unique equations using these parts. A simple example: let's assume we have 3 parts of original objects that have the following values:</p>
<pre><code>a=1
b=2
c=3
</code></pre>
<p>(and for reference the part of real-world objects is not a simple number like <code>1</code> but a unique digital number describing the part, like the binary code for it <code>110101011101011101010111101110111100001010101111011.....</code>). With these numbers we could create endless amounts of equations:</p>
<pre><code>1: a+b+c=6
2: c-b-a=0
3: b-c+a=0
4: 2b+a-c=2
5: 5c-b-a=12
......
</code></pre>
<p>Mathematically we only need 3 to describe the content (=value) of the fragments. But creating more adds reliability. Now store those equations distributed (one equation per physical storage device) and forget the original object. So we no longer have access to the values of a, b, c and see, and we just remember the locations of all the equations created with the original data fragments. Mathematically we need three equations (any 3 of the total) to recover the original values for a, b or c. So do a request to retrieve 3 of the many equations and the first 3 to arrive are good enough to recalculate the original values. Three randomly retrieved equations are:</p>
<pre><code>5c-b-a=12
b-c+a=0
2b+a-c=2
</code></pre>
<p>And this is a mathematical system we could solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>First: <code>b-c+a=0 -&gt; b=c-a</code></li>
<li>Second: <code>2b+a-c=2 -&gt; c=2b+a-2 -&gt; c=2(c-a)+a-2 -&gt; c=2c-2a+a-2 -&gt; c=a+2</code></li>
<li>Third: <code>5c-b-a=12 -&gt; 5(a+2)-(c-a)-a=12 -&gt; 5a+10-(a+2)+a-a=12 -&gt; 5a-a-2=2 -&gt; 4a=4 -&gt; a=1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know <code>a=1</code> we could solve the rest <code>c=a+2=3</code> and <code>b=c-a=2</code>. And we have from 3 random equations regenerated the original fragments and could now recreate the original object. </p>
<p>The redundancy and reliability in such system comes in the form of creating (more than needed) equations and storing them. As shown these equations in any random order could recreate the original fragments and therefore redundancy comes in at a much lower overhead.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-164"><a class="header" href="#example-of-164">Example of 16/4</a></h3>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/quantumsafe_storage_algo.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each object is fragmented into 16 parts. So we have 16 original fragments for which we need 16 equations to mathematically describe them. Now let's make 20 equations and store them dispersedly on 20 devices. To recreate the original object we only need 16 equations, the first 16 that we find and collect which allows us to recover the fragment and in the end the original object. We could lose any 4 of those original 20 equations.</p>
<p>The likelihood of losing 4 independent, dispersed storage devices at the same time is very low. Since we have continuous monitoring of all of the stored equations, we could create additional equations immediately when one of them is missing, making it an auto-regeneration of lost data and a self-repairing storage system. The overhead in this example is 4 out of 20 which is a mere <strong>20%</strong> instead of (up to) <strong>400%.</strong></p>
<h3 id="content-distribution-policy-1050"><a class="header" href="#content-distribution-policy-1050">Content distribution Policy (10/50)</a></h3>
<p>This system can be used as backend for content delivery networks.</p>
<p>Imagine a movie being stored on 60 locations from which we can loose 50 at the same time.</p>
<p>If someone now wants to download the data, the first 10 locations who answer fastest will provide enough of the data parts to allow the data to be rebuild.</p>
<p>The overhead here is much more, compared to previous example, but stil order of magnitude lower compared to other cdn systems.</p>
<h3 id="datarot"><a class="header" href="#datarot">Datarot</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Datarot cannot happen on this storage system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fact that data storage degrades over time and becomes unreadable, on e.g. a harddisk.
The storage system provided by ThreeFold intercepts this silent data corruption, making that it can pass by unnotified.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="zero-knowledge-proof"><a class="header" href="#zero-knowledge-proof">Zero Knowledge Proof</a></h3>
<p>The quantum save storage system is zero knowledge proof compliant. The storage system is made up / split into 2 components: the actual storage devices use to store the data (ZDB's) and the Quantum Safe Storage engine. </p>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/qss_system.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The zero proof knowledge compliancy comes from the fact that all the physical storage nodes (3nodes) can proof that they store a valid part of what data the quantum safe storage engine (QSSE) has stored on multiple independent devices. The QSSE can validate that all the QSSE storage devices have a valid part of the original information. The storage devices however have no idea what the original stored data is as they only have a part (description) of the origina data, and have no access to the original data part or the complete origal data objects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zero Boot = Zero-OS boot process</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ZOS Boot is a boot facility that allows 3nodes to boot from network boot servers located in the TF Grid. This boot mechanism creates as little as possible operational and administration overhead. ZOS Boot is a crucial part for enabling autonomy by <em>not</em> having the operating system installed on local disks on 3nodes. With a boot network facility and no local operating system files you immediately erase a number of operational and administration tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>to install the operating system to start with</li>
<li>to keep track of which systems run which version of the operating system (especially in large setups, this is a complicated and error prone task)</li>
<li>to keep track of patches and bug fixes that have been applied to systems</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the administration and operational part of maintaining a server estate with local installed operating system. On the security side of things the benefits are even greater:</p>
<ul>
<li>many hacking activities are geared towards adding to or changing parts of the operating system files. This is a threat from local physical access to servers as well as over the network. When there are no local operating system files installed this threat doesn't exist.</li>
<li>accidental overwrite, delete or corruption of operating system files. Servers run many processes and many of these processes have administrative access to be able to do what they need to do. Accidental deletion or overwrites of crucial files on disk will make the server fail a reboot.</li>
<li>access control. If there is no local operating system installed, access control, user rights, etc. are unnecessary functions and features, and don't have to be implemented.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this image from fs, a small partition is mounted in memory to start booting the machine, it gets IPXE (downloads what it needs), and then 0-OS boots. 
After that, it is going to the hub, downloading different lists. </p>
<p>There is one main flist that triggers downloads of multiple flists (see hub, and then https://hub.grid.tf/tf-zos/zos:development:latest.flist.md ). 
In there all the components/daemons that do part of the 0-OS. 
Also the download of the zos-bins, i.e. external binaries are triggered this way (https://hub.grid.tf/tf-zos-bins). </p>
<p>The core components of zero-os can be found in: <a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/tree/master/bins/packages">Zero-OS repo</a> = If something changes in the directory, a workflow is triggered to rebuild the full flist and push it to the hub. </p>
<p>When a node discovers there is a new version of one of these lists on the hub, it downloads it and restarts the daemon with the new version. 
Over the lifetime of the node, it keeps pulling on the hub directories to check whether new daemons/flists/binaries are available and whether things need to be upgraded.</p>

<p><img src="technology/zos/benefits/img/network_architecture2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>True peer2peer is a principle that exists everywhere within Threefold's technology stack, especially on its Network Architecture. Farmers produce IT capacity by connecting hardwares to the network and installing Zero-OS. The peer2peer network of devices forms the TF Grid. This TF Grid is an universal TFChain of which a large variety of IT workloads exist and run.</p>
<h2 id="peer2peer-networking"><a class="header" href="#peer2peer-networking">Peer2peer networking</a></h2>
<p>The TF Grid is built by 3Nodes (hardware + Zero-OS) that are connected to the internet by using the IPv6 protocol. To future-proof this grid, IPv6 has been chosen as ThreeFold Grid's native networking technology. The TF Grid operates on IPv6 (where available) and creates peer2peer network connections between all the containers (and other primitives). Please find more about Zero-OS primitives in our <a href="technology/zos/benefits/manuals">SDK manual</a>.</p>
<p>This creates a many-to-many web of (encrypted) point-to-point network connections which together make a (private) secure <strong>overlay network</strong>. This network is completely private and connects only the primitives that have been deployed in your network.</p>
<p>TF Network Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect all containers point-to-point</li>
<li>All traffic is encrypted</li>
<li>High performance</li>
<li>The shortest path between two end-points, multi-homed containers</li>
<li>Could span large geographical areas and create virtual data centers</li>
<li>All created and made operational <strong>without</strong> public access from the internet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="existing-enterprise-private-networks"><a class="header" href="#existing-enterprise-private-networks">Existing Enterprise Private Networks</a></h2>
<p>At Threefold, we are aware of the existence of private networks, IPsec, VPN, WAN's and more. We have the facility to create bridges to make these networks part of the deployed private overlay networks. This is in an early stage development, but with the right level(s) of interest this could be built out and carried out in the near future.</p>

<p>A deduped filesystem which is more efficient compared to images as used in other Virtual Machine technology.</p>
<h2 id="uses-flist-inside"><a class="header" href="#uses-flist-inside">Uses FLIST Inside</a></h2>
<p>In Zero-OS, <code>flist</code> is the format used to store zmachine images. This format is made to provide a complete mountable remote filesystem, but downloading only the files contents that you actually needs.</p>
<p>In practice, Flist itself is a small database which contains metadata about files and directories, file payload are stored on a tfgrid hub. You only need to download payload when you need it, this dramatically reduce zmachine boot time, bandwidth and disk overhead.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-zflist-concept"><a class="header" href="#why-this-zflist-concept">Why this ZFlist Concept</a></h3>
<p>Have you ever been in the following situation: you need two small files but they are embedded in a large archive.  How to get to those two files in an efficient way?  What a disappointment when you see this archive is 4 GB large and you only need four files of 2 MB inside. You'll need to download the full archive, store it somewhere to extract only what you need. Time, effort and bandwidth wasted.</p>
<p>You want to start a Docker container and the base image you want to use is 2 GB. What do you need to do before being able to use your container? Waiting to get the 2 GB downloaded. This problem exists everywhere but in Europe and the US where the bandwidth speeds are such that this doesn't present a real problem anymore, hence none of the leading (current) tech companies are looking for solutions.</p>
<p>We believe that there should be a smarter way of dealing with this than simply throwing larger bandwidth at the problem: what if you could only download the files you actually want and not the full blob (archive, image, whatever...).</p>
<p>ZFList is splitting metadata and data. Metadata is referential information about everything you need to know about content of the archive, but without the payload. Payload is the content of the referred files. The ZFList is exactly that: it consists of metadata with references that point to where to get the payload itself. So if you don't need it you won't get it.</p>
<p>As soon as you have the flist mounted, you can see the full directory tree, and walk around it. The files are only downloaded and presented at moment that you try to access them. In other words, every time you want to read a file, or modify it, Zero FS will download it, so that the data is available too. You only download on-the-fly what you need which reduces dramatically the bandwidth requirement.</p>

<p>The planetary network is an overlay network which lives on top of the existing internet or other peer2peer networks created. In this network, everyone is connected to everyone. End-to-end encryption between users of an app and the app running behind the network wall.</p>
<p>Each user end network point is strongly authenticated and uniquely identified, independent of the network carrier used. There is no need for a centralized firewall or VPN solutions, as there is a circle based networking security in place.</p>
<p>Benefits :</p>
<ul>
<li>It finds shortest possible paths between peers</li>
<li>There's full security through end-to-end encrypted messaging</li>
<li>It allows for peer2peer links like meshed wireless</li>
<li>It can survive broken internet links and re-route when needed</li>
<li>It resolves the shortage of IPV4 addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas current computer networks depend heavily on very centralized design and configuration, this networking concept breaks this mould by making use of a global spanning tree to form a scalable IPv6 encrypted mesh network. This is a peer2peer implementation of a networking protocol.</p>
<p>The following table illustrates high-level differences between traditional networks like the internet, and the planetary threefold network:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Traditional</th><th>Planetary Network</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>End-to-end encryption for all traffic across the network</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr>

<h2 id="what-are-the-problems-solved-here"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-problems-solved-here">What are the problems solved here?</a></h2>
<p>The internet as we know it today doesn’t conform to a well-defined topology. This has largely happened over time - as the internet has grown, more and more networks have been “bolted together”. The lack of defined topology gives us some unavoidable problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The routing tables that hold a “map” of the internet are huge and inefficient</li>
<li>There isn’t really any way for a computer to know where it is located on the internet relative to anything else</li>
<li>It’s difficult to examine where a packet will go on its journey from source to destination without actually sending it</li>
<li>It’s very difficult to install reliable networks into locations that change often or are non-static, i.e. wireless mesh networks</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems have been partially mitigated (but not really solved) through centralization - rather than your computers at home holding a copy of the global routing table, your ISP does it for you. Your computers and network devices are configured just to “send it upstream” and to let your ISP decide where it goes from there, but this does leave you entirely at the mercy of your ISP who can redirect your traffic anywhere they like and to inspect, manipulate or intercept it.</p>
<p>In addition, wireless meshing requires you to know a lot about the network around you, which would not typically be the case when you have outsourced this knowledge to your ISP. Many existing wireless mesh routing schemes are not scalable or efficient, and do not bridge well with existing networks.</p>

<li>Any app can get (securely) connected to the internet by any chosen IP address made available by ThreeFold network farmers through <a href="technology/primitives/network/webgw">WebGW</a></li>
<li>An app can be connected to multiple web gateways at once, the DNS round robin principle will provide load balancing and redundancy</li>
<li>An easy clustering mechanism where web gateways and nodes can be lost and the public service will still be up and running</li>
<li>Easy maintenance. When containers are moved or re-created, the same end user connection can be reused as that connection is terminated on the Web Gateway. The moved or newly created Web Gateway will recreate the socket to the Web Gateway and receive inbound traffic.</li>

<p>The Web Gateway is a mechanism to connect the private networks to the open Internet, in such a way that there is no direct connection between internet and the secure workloads running in the ZMachines.</p>
<p><img src="technology/primitives/network/img/webgateway.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="implementation-2"><a class="header" href="#implementation-2">Implementation</a></h3>
<p>Some 3nodes supports gateway functionality (configured by the farmers). A 3node with gateway configuration can then accept gateway workloads and then forward traffic to ZMachines that only have Planetary Network (planetary network) or Ipv6 addresses.</p>
<p>The gateway workloads consists of a name (prefix) that need to be reserved on the block chain first. Then the list of backend IPs. There are other flags that can be set to control automatic TLS (please check terraform documentations for the exact details of a reservation).</p>
<p>Once the 3node receives this workloads, the network configure proxy for this name and the Planetary Network IPs.</p>
<h3 id="security-2"><a class="header" href="#security-2">Security</a></h3>
<p>ZMachines have to have a Planetary Network IP or any other IPv6 (also IPv4 are accepted), it means that any person who is connected to the Planetary Network, can also reach the ZMachine without the need for a proxy.</p>
<p>So it's up to the ZMachine owner/maintainer to make sure it is secured and only have the required ports open.</p>

<p>The network architecture is a pure scale-out network system, it can scale to unlimited size, there is simply no bottleneck. Network &quot;supply&quot; is created by network farmers, and network &quot;demand&quot; is done by TF Grid users. Supply and demand scale independently, for supply there can be unlimited network, farmers providing the web gateways on their own 3nodes, and unlimited compute farmers providing 3nodes for compute and storage. The demand side is driven by developers creating software that runs on the grid, system integrators creating solutions for enterprises. This demand side is exponentially growing for data processing and storage use cases.</p>

<p>ThreeFold is a decentralized, sovereign and sustainable internet infrastructure platform with +US$ 50m invested and about 100 people working full time on the project. ThreeFold is driven by their mission to empower 1 billion people with sustainable access to a self-sovereign Internet by 2030. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THREEFOLD IS ONE OF THE MAIN PROMOTORS OF OURTOWN AND OURWORLD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ThreeFold solves two serious problems present in the legacy stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost of expanding Internet infrastructure:</strong> Large-scale, centralized data centers cost billions to build. The Internet needs to triple its infrastructure size this decade to support emerging data requirements. With an upcoming global economic downturn, an alternative is needed urgently. Threefold flips the current model upside down, incentivizes anyone with electricity and network to connect computers from their home or office to expand the Internet and earn monthly revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loss of digital sovereignty and net-neutrality:</strong> 20 companies own the Internet’s infrastructure today. This threatens our sovereignty and net neutrality and is a major concern for countries worldwide that have already started to cut the Internet into pieces e.g. great firewall of China. ThreeFold’s secure serverless infrastructure provides a peer-to-peer Internet model that solves most of the sovereignty and security concerns present in today’s infrastructure stack.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="threefold-benefits-to-ourworld-znz"><a class="header" href="#threefold-benefits-to-ourworld-znz">ThreeFold benefits to OurWorld ZNZ</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All data remains within the country</li>
<li>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML). This identity needs to be unique on a country scale and usable for all digital services of the government as well as private sector if they would like to</li>
<li>All critical data (billing, identity, records, etc) are stored on a quantum safe storage system which means</li>
<li>Data can never be lost</li>
<li>Data can never be corrupted</li>
<li>The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption</li>
<li>All history stays intact, data cannot be modified</li>
<li>Encryption technology is NOT enough for security, because it is not quantum safe</li>
<li>The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and needs to be able to scale to at least 1000 petabyte to be ready for the future</li>
<li>Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) required</li>
<li>Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact, uncorrupted and online.</li>
