<p>More and more people are choosing to embrace a location-independent, technology-enabled lifestyle that allows them to travel and work remotely. They are called digital nomads, and the trend is becoming more widespread.</p>
<p>It’s increasingly important for workers to be location independent, allowing them to live anywhere. Employers are listening as companies such as Lift, Airbnb and others have switched to permanent flexible work models. Countries such as the Netherlands also released a ‘flexible work act’ allowing people to request up-to 6 months of remote work annually. </p>
<p>Countries such as Germany, Estonia, Dubai or Mauritius have started issuing digital nomad visas, permitting digital nomads to live and work in the country for a longer period of time than a tourist visa. Nomad visas have experienced a +2000% increase over the past 5 years. </p>
<p>Digital nomads have no fixed residence and choose exciting locations as temporary residences while they work remotely. The choice of where to go usually depends on a lot of factors such as but not limitied safety, convenience, expenses and social life. The proposed Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) aims to form a co-ownership structure for existing and planned real estate developments that can appeal to digital nomads. The number of digital nomads have increased exponentially in the last years making the industry really valuable. The infographic below shows some statistics about the growing trend of living as a digital nomad.</p>
<p><img src="nomads/img/digital_nomad.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="unique-co-ownership-structure-of-a-diverse-real-estate-portfolio"><a class="header" href="#unique-co-ownership-structure-of-a-diverse-real-estate-portfolio">Unique co-ownership structure of a diverse real-estate portfolio</a></h2>
<p>The initial investment portfolio in the planned co-ownership structure features real estate developments and assets of various kinds in safe locations across the world. The different kinds of assets that the DAO will hold include buildings, boats, equipment and farmlands located in the Zanzibar archipelago, mainland Tanzania, Dubai, Egypt and Turkey. There are a total of 6 locations planned for co-living/working environments designed according to the needs of digital nomads. There are also many farming locations in Tanzania, which provides a diversified investment portfolio while helping us learn how to feed our communities with locally grown organic foods. </p>
<h2 id="convenience-for-digital-nomads"><a class="header" href="#convenience-for-digital-nomads">Convenience for digital nomads</a></h2>
<p>This project provides a lot of convenient accomodation options for the digital nomad community. A participating digital nomad will be able to choose a place to live and work from the different properties owned by the DAO. The processes for digital nomads to live in the premises can be streamlined and incentivized by tokenomics of the DAO. Visitors can move between different locations and still benefit from the established and trusted standards of living. The appealing locations of the assets and customized experience for digital nomads will ensure continued demand on the assets by digital nomads. </p>
<p>Then sustainability of operations of the assets are a priority. Many of the identified assets feature sustainable living options such as the boats in the Nile having electricty generation from installed solar panels, planned carbon-negative developments in Tanzania, and eco-living development in Turkey. All locations will strive to grow their food locally to provide organic food supply that meets the expectations of the resident digital nomad community. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="locations"><a class="header" href="#locations">Locations</a></h1>
<p>Our team has identified the following locations in the respective order of priority. </p>
<ol>
<li>Dubai, UAE - Paradise Hills</li>
<li>Zanzibar, Tanzania - Jungle Paradise Resort</li>
<li>Luxor, Egypt - Nile Veda Boats</li>
<li>Zanzibar, Tanzania - Fun Beach Hotel</li>
<li>Dar es Salaam, Tanzania - City of Peace</li>
<li>Mugla, Turkey - Yenice Valley</li>
<li>Zanzibar, Tanzania - Farmland</li>
<li>Mainland Tanzania - Farmland</li>
</ol>
<p>The community owned DAO will start acquiring real estate in the planned order of priorty, which might later change based on the opinions of the community. As more value is added to the DAO, the real estate portfolio of the DAO will get larger and all members will be the co-owners of the assets. The treasury of the DAO will increase in value over time thanks to the income from the assets. The DAO will then be able to make further additions to the asset portfolio, growing the value of the shares of all members.</p>
<p>OurWorld digital nomad believes in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regeneration (Ultra-comfortable spaces, organic food and healing activities, e.g. yoga )</li>
<li>Connection (Everything is designed to provide intimacy and bring people together) </li>
<li>Experience (Supportive environment that meets people’s personal and professional needs) </li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that more than just digital nomads, people are increasingly moving back towards community.  The current systems do not fit the human spirit, and people are waking up to it. 
To support the regenerative, inclusive and sovereign aspects of  OurWorld digital nomad, our properties are built around the following principles: </p>
<ul>
<li>Conscious living in sustainable structures </li>
<li>100% self-sovereign in regards to  food, energy production, internet infrastructure etc. </li>
<li>Regenerative organic farming is part of the business model to provide quality food to our residents and staff. </li>
<li>Working with local communities that tackle ESG concerns.</li>
<li>Networking events and retreats to support community building and ecosystem growth.</li>
<li>Co-working spaces (high internet speeds, access to best local sim-cards, community building sessions and tools, etc)</li>
<li>Nomad Experience (full access to regional activities – cultural, nature, sports, networking, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Jungle Paradise is based at Mbweni in Zanzibar and is home to a super nice boutique hotel, botanical gardens and ruins with a rich history.</p>
<p>The location was instrumental in the abolishment of slavery in Zanzibar and had a school where slave children had a chance to get educated and become free.</p>
<p>Mbweni was a Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) base and settlement for former slaves in the 19th century. The ruins of St Mary’s School for Girls, built by missionaries for girls freed from slave ships, is now set amid the lush gardens of Mbweni Ruins.</p>
<p>The Historic Ruins of the Mbweni School for freed slaves was founded in 1874, with associations with Sir John Kirk, Zanzibar’s first scientific botanist. </p>

<p>The farm lands across Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania are cheap and don't reflect their potential. Through our efforts and incentives, these lands will be used as regenerative farming zones. A large part of the land will be used to demonstrate how farming can be done which</p>
<ul>
<li>Only uses organic fertilizers, which can mainly also be produced on land</li>
<li>Has a high yield (good output), in relation to size of land yet still completely organic and in line with nature.</li>
<li>As an education facility, we want to show farming communities and education facilities how such a way of farming is effective and good local communities, people and planet.
We will create and test solutions in line to organic fertilizer, water recuperation, food forests, natural defense mechanisms, and organic pest control . All the best practices will be documented with video and documents, these documents will be made available for everyone as well as kept opensource.</li>
</ul>
<p>These projects to be developed on the land ensures the continued demand of the purchased farmlands.They will also help our communities in other locations localize their food supply. The food produced in Zanzibar will be used by the living community but also sold to local markets and if surplus exported. The knowledge gathered from the farming activities will be shared and can be used in other locations to make our communities more self-sufficient.</p>

<p>Being a part of OurWorld Nomads is also an investment into solutions that go against the trend shown in the inforgraphic below.

THe amount of investment that need to be done on certain locations for renovations or development are also listed. </p>
<p>The last column shows the amount to be paid to acquire the identified assets. <strong>It is shown that the estimated value of all the locations combined of $87 million is significantly larger than the amount needed to purchase the assets, which is $30.65 million. This is the big opportunity that brought this project alive.</strong></p>

<p>The idea is that everyone invests as a convertible loan. Conversion will be done to governance tokens once phase 2 is done, or returned over time as income is generated or more DAO tokens sold, in other words it's ok to stay in as loan and just get money back over time as well. </p>

<p>The local SPVs are not for profit and work and their management can only execute on directions as given by the DAO. Their role is to deal with the operations of the assets locally. The DAO of the parent organiation has 100% community managed governance, which means the DAO can accept proposal for change or grants. The members of the DAO then vote on the proposals. </p>

<p>The Digital Nomad Tokens - DNT are valuable and represent your part of the total economic system. 
You can use your DNT to do the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Come and stay in one of the Creator Zones (there are family homes, rooms for individuals, …)</li>
<li>Pay for your stay, food, … </li>
<li>Rent one of our organic beautiful homes in Zanzibar, ideal to replenish yourself and your friends and family.</li>
<li>Join one of the retreats on the Nile or in Zanzibar (later India Kerala probably)</li>
<li>Each retreat has as purpose to let you experience the amazing power of regenerative food and medicine and healing practices eg. Ayurvedic, Energy Healing, Yoga, Sound Healing, …</li>
<li>Join cruises on the Nile for an unforgettable experience combining above practices with the energy of the Nile and its temples. Regular cruises are organized and you can rent your room(s).</li>
<li>Or you can rent one or more of our ships on the Nile (organic food, solar power, luxe rooms, …) and organize your own event. Our ecosystem of artists, healers will be very happy to help.</li>
