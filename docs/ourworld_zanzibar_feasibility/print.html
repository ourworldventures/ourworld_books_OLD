<p>Web 4 is a new concept which is the combination of Web 3 (blockchain) and digital twin technology.</p>
<p>Its a concept with many advantages like</p>
<ul>
<li>less power usage</li>
<li>more scalability</li>
<li>more flexibility</li>
<li>faster development</li>
<li>more security</li>

<p><strong>Specific for storage, there are some cool features:</strong></p>
<p>Each twin has its own storage system where data cannot be lost or corrupted. Each twin decides for itself where the data will be stored.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ourledger"><a class="header" href="#ourledger">OurLedger</a></h1>
<p>OurLedger is the base consensus layer to develop any business or government solution on top of.</p>
<p><img src="web4/ourledger/img/consensus_subsystem.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Multiple VLang engines become the validators of this system. Each VLang engine runs smart contract code and will integrate with the blockchain through the consensus layer.</p>
<p>Only once the consensus is achieved, the result of the code will result in change in the real world (e.g. a blockchain), this allows for a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p>The blockchain is needed to support authentication, money transactions, multi signature, auditing records, ...</p>
<p>This approach is designed to be compatible with all existing blockchain technologies, although some are more efficient than others.</p>
<h3 id="benefits"><a class="header" href="#benefits">Benefits</a></h3>

<p><img src="web4/ourledger/img/web_remade_twin.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>The Twins can connect to any blockchain solutions, theey are close to the twins which are on safe locations where full blockchain nodes are deployed, this leads to even more security. In other words, it's not the browser of the user who connects to the blockchain, the browser of the user connects over the Browser Firewall to the apps running on the twin which connects the blockchain. Hackers have no possibility to abuse javascript or browser vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><img src="web4/ourledger/img/digital_twin_executor.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>This is also compatible with any other classic IT system running behind firewalls in protected environments. The Twins can connect to any possible IT system, blockchain or classic in an ultra secure setting.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="knox-security-vault"><a class="header" href="#knox-security-vault">Knox Security Vault</a></h1>

<p><img src="web4/finance/img/distributed_storage.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Each Knox Security Vault is an ultra safe area. Thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage system, it is not possible to retrieve a key even if a hacker would be in one safe, as a combination of three safes is required to recover information.</p>
<p>We suggest using the key storage in the following way: each wallet from a user stores the encrypted dispersed key distributed over four or five Knox Security Vaults. Only in the case of a disaster and user strong identification, an user could get access (in the case of death of the customer, to hand-over to the relatives).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="peer2peer-reputation-system"><a class="header" href="#peer2peer-reputation-system">Peer2Peer Reputation System</a></h1>
<p>Reputation is a very important part to any financial system. This allows users to see the reputation of the people they are transacting or doing business with.</p>
<p>We are developing a unique peer2peer reputation system to allow the power of network effects to come up with strong verification and reputation proofs. We think this might become an important added value that any financial institution  government could deliver to its customers/citizens.</p>
<p>Such a system can easily be integrated and extended by a standard KYC and AML system.</p>
<p>This goes had in had with the Proof of Authenticity system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="proof-of-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#proof-of-authenticity">Proof of Authenticity</a></h1>
<p>Proof of Authenticity (PoA) is an algorithm that allows peers to verify that people, products and statements on the ThreeFold Grid are genuine. It acts as a reputation engine to validate any information on the grid. </p>
<h2 id="why-proof-of-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#why-proof-of-authenticity">Why Proof of Authenticity</a></h2>
<p>Any system that contains a vast amount of information, should require proof of authenticity.</p>
<p>We believe users should be able to measure authenticity in relation to</p>
<ul>
<li>The people they connect with;</li>
<li>The products and services they access;</li>
<li>The information they consume.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, to automate information search in a decentralized and trustful environemnt, an algorithm that is able to scale information verification in a neutral way is required. </p>
<p>Proof of authenticity puts forward a very simple method to verify the genuiness of information.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how PoA works in a decentralized context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone fills in their profile with their personal and professional data. </li>
<li>A former colleague finds their information and verifies their information as being authentic. </li>
<li>Once a user gets verified e.g. 10 times, they can be trusted to be real and genuine. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above can also apply to products, statements and more. In that sense, PoA can solve multiple digital challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The verifiability of information and news </li>
<li>A non-biased way to rate products and services. </li>
<li>website authenticity </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applicability"><a class="header" href="#applicability">Applicability</a></h2>
<p>POA can be used for any type of information but one of the first ones is identity, KYC/AML is a mechanism to identify people but peer authentication is a very powerful way to extend this with.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="blockchain-pruning"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-pruning">Blockchain Pruning</a></h1>
<p><img src="web4/ourledger/img/pruning.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Existing blockchains don’t have a pruning feature, which means old data cannot get archived, this leads to very large blockchains rather quickly. We have developed a technology which can enable any chosen blockchain and allow old data to be parked on the Quantum Safe Storage system (means can never be corrupted or lost). It means only active data remain on the online chain, this allows for much more scalability and better utilization of the hardware.</p>
<p>To do effective pruning we need to modify parts of the chosen blockchain, but we know how to do this.</p>

<p>Ultra Scalable &amp; Secure Decentralized Deployment</p>
<p><strong>Example deployment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lots of locations (offices, banks, small datacenters, universities, ...), each providing compute &amp; storage to a private and/or public grid by means of the 3Nodes</li>
<li>Each node runs Zero-OS which has no shell and cannot be accessed by any person in the organization (bank, government, enterprise)</li>
<li>None of the nodes has enough data to allow anyone to reconstruct the data</li>
<li>The different nodes together deliver a super resilient network of compute &amp; network resources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Even if, in a disaster scenario, 30% of the locations would go down, the system would still function and be available to its users. This is the most reliable deployment possible in IT landscape today.</strong></p>
<p>What runs on the 3Nodes</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain Nodes</li>
<li>The distributed storage system (ultra safe, zero-knowledge proof)</li>
<li>Digital Twins for users</li>
<li>Secure Browser Engines (can be in ultra safe location)</li>

<p><img src="web4/zos/img/cloudlayer.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To allow web4 to work we need a reliable cloud layer, which is a layer capable to execute all workloads as described in this document in a safe and a reliable way.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ultra-secure-operating-system--zero-os"><a class="header" href="#ultra-secure-operating-system--zero-os">Ultra Secure Operating System = Zero-OS</a></h1>
<p><img src="web4/zos/img/zero_os.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>Zero-OS is a lightweight and efficient operating system. There is no shell, local nor remote. It supports a small number of primitives; the low-level functions it could perform natively in the operating system. Zero-OS (ZOS) is the operating system which allows the 3Nodes to be used to provide IT capacity in all safety to its applications. ZOS has been developed by ThreeFold from scratch, starting from the Linux kernel with the purpose to improve on efficiency, energy usage, performance, scale, cost of management and security. All applications, twins and blockchains are secured by the Zero-OS operating system.</p>
<h3 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h3>
<p>Most centrally managed operating systems rely on human management and intervention, which leads to downtime and security issues.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the Internet, the development of operating systems mostly arises through the addition of further layers of code to improve capabilities and functionalities of software, this leads to too much complexity, performance loss, and energy usage issues.</p>
<p>To build a truly scalable, private and efficient Internet infrastructure, we had to start from scratch to ensure a minimal hacking surface, improve efficiency, and ensure that anyone who connects hardware to the ThreeFold Grid wouldn’t be able to access the private user data thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage System.</p>
<p>The result is game-changing as ZOS is able to provide the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateless: without shell, local or remote, it does not allow for inbound network connections to happen nor can data be fetched by node operators.</li>
<li>Lightweight: Zero-OS can save up-to 10X energy on storage workloads.</li>
<li>Autonomous: it runs by itself and doesn’t require humans to maintain it, removing human error and considerably reducing the hacking surface.</li>
<li>Decentralized: deploy IT workloads and infrastructures in a private and neutral environment.</li>
<li>Secure: store workloads in a quantum safe (future proof) way.</li>
<li>Private: communicate end-to-end without centralized servers or APIs in the middle.</li>
<li>Compatible: run anything that can run on Linux but in a decentralized environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="web4/zos/img/zero_os_server.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>Imagine an operating system with the following benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Upto 10x more efficient for certain workloads (e.g. storage)</li>
<li>No installation required</li>
<li>All files are deduplicated for the VM’s, containers and the ZOS itself, no more data duplicated filesystems</li>
<li>The hacking footprint is super small, which leads to much more safe systems</li>
<li>Every file is fingerprinted and gets checked at launch time of an application</li>
<li>There is no shell or server interface on the operating system</li>
<li>The networks are end2end encrypted between all Nodes</li>
<li>There is the possibility to completely disconnect the compute/storage from the network service part which means hackers have a lot less chance to get to the data.</li>
<li>A smart contract for IT layer allows groups of people to deploy IT workloads with concensus and full control</li>
<li>All workloads which can run on linux, can run on Zero-OS but in a much more controlled, private and safe way</li>

<li>ultra reliable, data can not be lost</li>

</ul>
<p>It is not a dream, it does already exist, and is the underpinning of the ultra safe <strong>Cloud &amp; Internet Backend System</strong> empowering this solution.</p>
<p>Our storage architecture follows the true Peer To Peer design. Any participating nodes (can be on ultra safe locations) only store small incomplete parts of data (files, photos, movies, databases…) by only offering a slice of their current (local) storage devices. Managing the storage and retrieval of all these ‘distributed fragments’ is done by a software that creates ‘development and/or end-user interfaces’ for this storage algorithm. We call this ‘dispersed storage‘.</p>

<p><img src="web4/storage/img/qss_twin.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each Twin or Executor stores the data on a quantum safe filesystem, which means data can never be lost, any application just sees a normal filesystem so it's compatible with any application.</p>
<p>This is an ultra scalable design, there are no limits to the size which can be achieved.</p>
<p>This is a ‘zero knowledge’ proof system which means that, once the data leaves the twin it is impossible for any hacker or even quantum computer to get access or to modify the data, there is simply not enough information available.</p>
<p>A redundant filesystem can store PB’s (millions of gigabytes) of information.</p>
<p>Unique features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited scalable (many petabytes) filesystem</li>
<li>Quantum Safe: even if used on the ThreeFold Grid, no farmer knows what the data is about</li>
<li>Even a quantum computer cannot decrypt</li>
<li>Data can’t be lost</li>
<li>Protection for datarot, data will auto repair</li>
<li>Data is kept forever</li>
<li>Data is dispersed over multiple sites</li>
<li>Sites can go down, data not lost</li>
<li>Up to 10x more efficient than storing on classic storage cloud systems</li>
<li>Can be mounted as a filesystem on any OS or any deployment system (OSX, Linux, Windows, Docker, Kubernetes, ThreeFold Grid, …)</li>
<li>Compatible with ± all data workloads (not high performance data driven workloads like a database)</li>
<li>Self-healing: when a node or disk is lost, storage system can get back to the original redundancy level</li>
<li>Helps with compliance to regulations like GDPR (as the hosting facility has no view on what is stored, information is encrypted and incomplete)</li>
<li>Hybrid: can be installed onsite, public, private, …</li>

<p>For ultra secure use cases, the user doesn't use javascript in his browser, he connects over an ultra secure end2end encrypted and multi authenticated link from his browser to a secure location. In the secure location, the secure browser engine gives access to the required web and banking applications which connect further.</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/twin_functions.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>As an option, the web sessions can be recorded for auditing or anti-hacking/fraud detection, also in a secure location.</p>
<p>The twin can communicate with other twins, in a close ultra secure context, giving no chance to hackers to interfere. The data is stored on a Quantum Safe Storage system (see further).</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/cyber_security.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>This leads to very good protection and ‘Auditing’ opportunities.</p>
<p>Cyber crime will have a much harder time to be successful, way more difficult (we hope impossible).</p>
<p>Even in the very unlikely event a hacker would succeed, he would only interfere with one twin, which means only one customer would be affected!!!  This makes it so much harder for hackers to deploy capital to hack and social engineer their way into a secure environment.</p>

<h3 id="zero-os"><a class="header" href="#zero-os">Zero-OS</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold has build its own operating system called Zero-OS, which was based starting from a Linux Kernel with as purpose to remove all the unnecessary complexities found on contemporary OS's. </p>
<p>Zero-OS supports a small number of primitives, and performs low-level functions natively. </p>
<p>It delivers 3 primitive functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>storage capacity</li>
<li>compute capacity </li>
<li>network capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no shell, local nor remote attached to Zero-OS. It does not allow for inbound network connections to happen to the core. Also, given its shell-less nature, the people and organizations, called farmers, that run 3nodes cannot issue any commands nor access its features. In that sense, Zero-OS enables a &quot;zero people&quot; (autonomous) Internet, meaning hackers cannot get in, while also eliminating human error from the paradigm. </p>
<h3 id="3node"><a class="header" href="#3node">3Node</a></h3>
<p>The ThreeFold_Grid needs hardware/servers to function. Servers of all shapes and sizes can be added to the grid by anyone, anywhere in the world. The production of Internet Capacity on the Threefold Grid is called Farming and people who add these servers to the grid are called Farmers. This is a fully decentralized process and they get rewarded by the means of TFT. </p>
<p>Farmers download the Zero-OS operating system and boot their servers themselves. Once booted, these servers become 3Nodes. The 3Nodes will register themselves in a database called the TF Explorer. Once registered in the TF Explorer, the capacity of the 3Nodes will become available on the TF Grid Explorer. Also, given the autonomous nature of the ThreeFold Grid, there is no need for any intermediaries between the user and 3Nodes. </p>
<p>This enables a complete peer2peer environment for people to reserve their Internet Capacity directly from the hardware.</p>

<p>Peer2peer provides the unique proposition of selecting storage providers that match your application and service of business criteria. For example, you might be looking to store data for your application in a certain geographic area (for governance and compliance) reasons. You might also want to use different &quot;storage policies&quot; for different types of data. Examples are live versus archived data. All of these uses cases are possible with this storage architecture, and could be built by using the same building blocks produced by farmers and consumed by developers or end-users.</p>

<h2 id="mount-any-files-in-your-storage-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#mount-any-files-in-your-storage-infrastructure">Mount Any Files in your Storage Infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>The QSFS is a mechanism to mount any file system (in any format) on the grid, in a quantum-secure way. </p>
<p>This storage layer relies on 3 primitives of the ThreeFold technology : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db">0-db</a> is the storage engine.
It is an always append database, which stores objects in an immutable format. It allows keeping the history out-of-the-box, good performance on disk, low overhead, easy data structure and easy backup (linear copy and immutable files).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-stor_v2">0-stor-v2</a> is used to disperse the data into chunks by performing 'forward-looking error-correcting code' (FLECC) on it and send the fragments to safe locations.
It takes files in any format as input, encrypts the file with AES based on a user-defined key, then FLECC-encodes the file and spreads out the result
to multiple 0-DBs. The number of generated chunks is configurable to make it more or less robust against data loss through unavailable fragments. Even if some 0-DBs are unreachable, you can still retrieve the original data, and missing 0-DBs can even be rebuilt to have full consistency. It's an essential element of the operational backup. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-db-fs">0-db-fs</a> is the filesystem driver which uses 0-DB as a primary storage engine. It manages the storage of directories and metadata in a dedicated namespace and file payloads in another dedicated namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they form a storage layer that is quantum secure: even the most powerful computer can't hack the system because no single node contains all of the information needed to reconstruct the data.</p>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/quantum_safe_storage.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This concept scales forever, and you can bring any file system on top of it: </p>
<ul>
<li>S3 storage </li>
<li>any backup system</li>
<li>an ftp-server</li>
<li>IPFS and Hypercore distributed file sharing protocols </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>By using our filesystem inside a Virtual Machine or Kubernetes, the TFGrid user can deploy any storage application on top e.g. Minio for S3 storage, OwnCloud as online fileserver.</p>

<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/qss_scaleout.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Quantum Safe Storage Algorithm is the heart of the Storage engine. The storage engine takes the original data objects and creates data part descriptions that it stores over many virtual storage devices (ZDB/s)</p>
<p>Data gets stored over multiple ZDB's in such a way that data can never be lost.</p>
<p>Unique features</p>
<ul>
<li>data always append, can never be lost</li>
<li>even a quantum computer cannot decrypt the data</li>
<li>is spread over multiple sites, sites can be lost, data will still be available</li>
<li>protects for datarot.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-1"><a class="header" href="#why-1">Why</a></h3>
<p>Today we produce more data than ever before. We could not continue to make full copies of data to make sure it is stored reliably. This will simply not scale. We need to move from securing the whole dataset to securing all the objects that make up a dataset.</p>
<p>ThreeFold is using space technology to store data (fragments) over multiple devices (physical storage devices in 3Nodes). The solution does not distribute and store parts of an object (file, photo, movie...) but describes the part of an object. This could be visualized by thinking of it as equations.</p>
<h3 id="details"><a class="header" href="#details">Details</a></h3>
<p>Let a,b,c,d.... be the parts of that original object. You could create endless unique equations using these parts. A simple example: let's assume we have 3 parts of original objects that have the following values:</p>
<pre><code>a=1
b=2
c=3
</code></pre>
<p>(and for reference the part of real-world objects is not a simple number like <code>1</code> but a unique digital number describing the part, like the binary code for it <code>110101011101011101010111101110111100001010101111011.....</code>). With these numbers we could create endless amounts of equations:</p>
<pre><code>1: a+b+c=6
2: c-b-a=0
3: b-c+a=0
4: 2b+a-c=2
5: 5c-b-a=12
......
</code></pre>
<p>Mathematically we only need 3 to describe the content (=value) of the fragments. But creating more adds reliability. Now store those equations distributed (one equation per physical storage device) and forget the original object. So we no longer have access to the values of a, b, c and see, and we just remember the locations of all the equations created with the original data fragments. Mathematically we need three equations (any 3 of the total) to recover the original values for a, b or c. So do a request to retrieve 3 of the many equations and the first 3 to arrive are good enough to recalculate the original values. Three randomly retrieved equations are:</p>
<pre><code>5c-b-a=12
b-c+a=0
2b+a-c=2
</code></pre>
<p>And this is a mathematical system we could solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>First: <code>b-c+a=0 -&gt; b=c-a</code></li>
<li>Second: <code>2b+a-c=2 -&gt; c=2b+a-2 -&gt; c=2(c-a)+a-2 -&gt; c=2c-2a+a-2 -&gt; c=a+2</code></li>
<li>Third: <code>5c-b-a=12 -&gt; 5(a+2)-(c-a)-a=12 -&gt; 5a+10-(a+2)+a-a=12 -&gt; 5a-a-2=2 -&gt; 4a=4 -&gt; a=1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know <code>a=1</code> we could solve the rest <code>c=a+2=3</code> and <code>b=c-a=2</code>. And we have from 3 random equations regenerated the original fragments and could now recreate the original object. </p>
<p>The redundancy and reliability in such system comes in the form of creating (more than needed) equations and storing them. As shown these equations in any random order could recreate the original fragments and therefore redundancy comes in at a much lower overhead.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-164"><a class="header" href="#example-of-164">Example of 16/4</a></h3>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/quantumsafe_storage_algo.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each object is fragmented into 16 parts. So we have 16 original fragments for which we need 16 equations to mathematically describe them. Now let's make 20 equations and store them dispersedly on 20 devices. To recreate the original object we only need 16 equations, the first 16 that we find and collect which allows us to recover the fragment and in the end the original object. We could lose any 4 of those original 20 equations.</p>
<p>The likelihood of losing 4 independent, dispersed storage devices at the same time is very low. Since we have continuous monitoring of all of the stored equations, we could create additional equations immediately when one of them is missing, making it an auto-regeneration of lost data and a self-repairing storage system. The overhead in this example is 4 out of 20 which is a mere <strong>20%</strong> instead of (up to) <strong>400%.</strong></p>
<h3 id="content-distribution-policy-1050"><a class="header" href="#content-distribution-policy-1050">Content distribution Policy (10/50)</a></h3>
<p>This system can be used as backend for content delivery networks.</p>
<p>Imagine a movie being stored on 60 locations from which we can loose 50 at the same time.</p>
<p>If someone now wants to download the data, the first 10 locations who answer fastest will provide enough of the data parts to allow the data to be rebuild.</p>
<p>The overhead here is much more, compared to previous example, but stil order of magnitude lower compared to other cdn systems.</p>
<h3 id="datarot"><a class="header" href="#datarot">Datarot</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Datarot cannot happen on this storage system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fact that data storage degrades over time and becomes unreadable, on e.g. a harddisk.
The storage system provided by ThreeFold intercepts this silent data corruption, making that it can pass by unnotified.</p>

<h3 id="zero-knowledge-proof"><a class="header" href="#zero-knowledge-proof">Zero Knowledge Proof</a></h3>
<p>The quantum save storage system is zero knowledge proof compliant. The storage system is made up / split into 2 components: the actual storage devices use to store the data (ZDB's) and the Quantum Safe Storage engine. </p>
<p><img src="technology/qsss/img/qss_system.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The zero proof knowledge compliancy comes from the fact that all the physical storage nodes (3nodes) can proof that they store a valid part of what data the quantum safe storage engine (QSSE) has stored on multiple independent devices. The QSSE can validate that all the QSSE storage devices have a valid part of the original information. The storage devices however have no idea what the original stored data is as they only have a part (description) of the origina data, and have no access to the original data part or the complete origal data objects.</p>

<p>Zero Boot = Zero-OS boot process</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ZOS Boot is a boot facility that allows 3nodes to boot from network boot servers located in the TF Grid. This boot mechanism creates as little as possible operational and administration overhead. ZOS Boot is a crucial part for enabling autonomy by <em>not</em> having the operating system installed on local disks on 3nodes. With a boot network facility and no local operating system files you immediately erase a number of operational and administration tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>to install the operating system to start with</li>
<li>to keep track of which systems run which version of the operating system (especially in large setups, this is a complicated and error prone task)</li>
<li>to keep track of patches and bug fixes that have been applied to systems</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the administration and operational part of maintaining a server estate with local installed operating system. On the security side of things the benefits are even greater:</p>
<ul>
<li>many hacking activities are geared towards adding to or changing parts of the operating system files. This is a threat from local physical access to servers as well as over the network. When there are no local operating system files installed this threat doesn't exist.</li>
<li>accidental overwrite, delete or corruption of operating system files. Servers run many processes and many of these processes have administrative access to be able to do what they need to do. Accidental deletion or overwrites of crucial files on disk will make the server fail a reboot.</li>
<li>access control. If there is no local operating system installed, access control, user rights, etc. are unnecessary functions and features, and don't have to be implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how"><a class="header" href="#how">How?</a></h3>
<p>In this image from fs, a small partition is mounted in memory to start booting the machine, it gets IPXE (downloads what it needs), and then 0-OS boots. 
After that, it is going to the hub, downloading different lists. </p>
<p>There is one main flist that triggers downloads of multiple flists (see hub, and then https://hub.grid.tf/tf-zos/zos:development:latest.flist.md ). 
In there all the components/daemons that do part of the 0-OS. 
Also the download of the zos-bins, i.e. external binaries are triggered this way (https://hub.grid.tf/tf-zos-bins). </p>
<p>The core components of zero-os can be found in: <a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/tree/master/bins/packages">Zero-OS repo</a> = If something changes in the directory, a workflow is triggered to rebuild the full flist and push it to the hub. </p>
<p>When a node discovers there is a new version of one of these lists on the hub, it downloads it and restarts the daemon with the new version. 
Over the lifetime of the node, it keeps pulling on the hub directories to check whether new daemons/flists/binaries are available and whether things need to be upgraded.</p>

<p><img src="technology/zos/benefits/img/network_architecture2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>True peer2peer is a principle that exists everywhere within Threefold's technology stack, especially on its Network Architecture. Farmers produce IT capacity by connecting hardwares to the network and installing Zero-OS. The peer2peer network of devices forms the TF Grid. This TF Grid is an universal TFChain of which a large variety of IT workloads exist and run.</p>
<h2 id="peer2peer-networking"><a class="header" href="#peer2peer-networking">Peer2peer networking</a></h2>
<p>The TF Grid is built by 3Nodes (hardware + Zero-OS) that are connected to the internet by using the IPv6 protocol. To future-proof this grid, IPv6 has been chosen as ThreeFold Grid's native networking technology. The TF Grid operates on IPv6 (where available) and creates peer2peer network connections between all the containers (and other primitives). Please find more about Zero-OS primitives in our <a href="technology/zos/benefits/manuals">SDK manual</a>.</p>
<p>This creates a many-to-many web of (encrypted) point-to-point network connections which together make a (private) secure <strong>overlay network</strong>. This network is completely private and connects only the primitives that have been deployed in your network.</p>
<p>TF Network Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect all containers point-to-point</li>
<li>All traffic is encrypted</li>
<li>High performance</li>
<li>The shortest path between two end-points, multi-homed containers</li>
<li>Could span large geographical areas and create virtual data centers</li>
<li>All created and made operational <strong>without</strong> public access from the internet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="existing-enterprise-private-networks"><a class="header" href="#existing-enterprise-private-networks">Existing Enterprise Private Networks</a></h2>
<p>At Threefold, we are aware of the existence of private networks, IPsec, VPN, WAN's and more. We have the facility to create bridges to make these networks part of the deployed private overlay networks. This is in an early stage development, but with the right level(s) of interest this could be built out and carried out in the near future.</p>
