# PLANET AND PEOPLE FIRST APPROACH

<img src="img/planet_people_profit.png" alt="planetpeopleprofit" width="200" style="float: right"/>

&nbsp;

We believe in:

* **Planet First**  
* **People Second**  
* **Profit As Result**  

&nbsp;

Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.

Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.
