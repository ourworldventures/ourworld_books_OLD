<p>Currently, most countries develop their digital future by implementing many independent projects which all act as painkillers to their problems. While a painkiller might fix symptoms, it rarely solves the root issue.</p>
<p>We believe your country has the opportunity to leapfrog straight to a solution which is both easier to implement and solves most of its issues all at once.</p>
<p>This has huge benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's much more cost effective</li>
<li>It's easier and more integrated which results in many benefits for the users</li>
<li>It will be safer (think about the cyber pandemic happening right now)</li>
<li>It is more prepared for the future</li>
<li>It's greener (such a system will use up to 100 times less energy)</li>

<ul>
<li>A government which is committed to make this work, and be different. Some companies and individuals might not want such a huge step forward. so we need to be ready to defend the project.</li>
<li>A sense of urgency, time is against us, the time is now. The world is changing; now is the best time to reach for our dreams.</li>

<li>Put a structure in place from which all of this can be executed. </li>

<p><img src="ourtown/img/residence1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We are building a carbon-neutral, mixed-use project in Zanzibar, the first of its kind. Our aim is to create a dynamic ecosystem of communities that drive economic growth and contribute to the diversification of the economy, while forging a nation-wide planet-first perspective. Core to our ethos is the concept of self-sufficiency. We believe that our sustainable city must uplift the many communities of Zanzibar, and be completely self-sufficient and sustainable.</p>
<p>OurTown believes in putting our planet first, people second and profits last. That’s the only model we believe can create real sustainable value. We aim to build this first blueprint in a way that nurtures breakthrough technologies while respecting Zanzibar’s cultural heritage and landscape. The blueprint builds on 7 integrated systems to support its ‘planet-human-centric’ vision: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Zero-waste and circular systems – Community-led waste management systems for recycling and upcycling, waste water, composting, biogasification and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon neutral energy systems –  A smart grid energy system with solar power as its primary source, and complemented with alternatives such as wind energy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food safety – With innovative community-led urban agriculture and regenerative farmlands, OurTown aims to achieve complete food security for its people and local communities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustainable water systems – By applying a suite of sustainable methods; rainwater harvesting, smart faucets, and greywater recycling, we aim to minimize water coming in and out of OurTown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sovereign Internet infrastructure – A built-in decentralized edge datacenter model which produces sovereign internet and cloud capacity for both physical and digital residents. The infrastructure can host any IT workload and the excess capacity can be rented to the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralized governance –  OurTown will be co-owned by its community members. The underlying internet infrastructure will support the autonomous, decentralized and transparent governance of all co-owned assets as well as future proposals for modifications to and developments of OurTown. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovation incubator – OurTown will be established as a regulatory sandbox, empowering the city with a unique legal framework. This will attract global talent to our innovation center to further develop the blueprint of a self-sovereign, decentralized and sustainable community and to nurture other cutting-edge projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These interconnected systems will generate 100% of the operational energy of OurTown and help OurTown establish complete self-sufficiency. We aim to integrate these technologies into the built environment in innovative and harmonious ways to enhance community well-being.</p>
<p>The target market of the city include start-ups, digital nomads, eco-tourists, employees and families. The digital businesses in the city will have a focus on cyber security, internet, AI, green tech &amp; IT, agritech, communication, software and gaming. The amenities within the city will serve the mentioned target market. </p>

<p>The plan above was developed with limited information on the exact size and shape of the land. It shows different residential and commercial options within the project as well as the services offered within the city. </p>
<p>Our team has started making initial designs for the city that can be used once the size and shape of the land are confirmed. Planning of the movement within the city and infrastructure of the development is also underway. We are in contact with multiple possible partners for partnerships on this aspect of the project as well. </p>
<h1 id="initial-designs-of-ourtown"><a class="header" href="#initial-designs-of-ourtown">Initial designs of OurTown</a></h1>
<p>The images used here are for illustrative and showcasing purposes only. After discussing in length with the appropriate authorities, final and more specific renders will be presented.</p>
<h2 id="sustainable-residences"><a class="header" href="#sustainable-residences">Sustainable residences</a></h2>
<p>The residences will be placed within greenery and nature. Inner roads of the city will dsiscourage cars to provide clean air and provide reduced noise pollution levels within then residential areas. Amenities such gyms, swimming pools, walking paths and cycling trails are located close to these areas for comfortable living and convenient access to other parts of the city.</p>

<h2 id="sustainable-offices"><a class="header" href="#sustainable-offices">Sustainable offices</a></h2>
<p>All of the commercial operators in OurTown will also be encouraged to follow planet-friendly practices. They will be able to use all of the green-technology available in OurTown to make their operations regenerative and sustainable. The concept Renderings below depict the the commercial areas and how they blend in with the residential areas and nature. </p>

<h2 id="regenerative-practices"><a class="header" href="#regenerative-practices">Regenerative practices</a></h2>
<p>OurTown has a commitment to be a carbon-neutral development, meaning renewable energy systems will be integrated into the city in many locations. There will be areas designated to energy generation and solar potential from roofs will also be realized. Using thermal insulating construction materials and windows, smart home automation, water-saving appliances, energy-saving electrical fittings and rooftop solar PVC installations, the new residents of Zanzibar’s  Sustainable City are projected to enjoy savings of up to 50% on their electricity and water bills.</p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/solar.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The food supply of the city will be supported by regenerative farming practives within and and outside the city. Integrated farming zones within the city will provide produce to the residents while serving as an educational tool for the youth. The regenerative farming locations that are close to Fumba will provide additional support to the food suply. </p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/farming.png" alt="" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="world-first"><a class="header" href="#world-first">World First</a></h1>
<p>We have plans and solutions to create a sustainable city that can fully sustain its needs for food, energy and core consumer products. Compared to conventional implementations of self-sufficiency, OurTown will have digital sovereignity and self-governance therough its own decentralized internet and digital backbone, facilitating communications, transactions and governance. OurTown will be the first ever development to achieve complete self-sufficinecy with sustainable living, digital sovereignty, and autonoous governance.</p>

<h3 id="physical-self-sufficiency-sustainable-living"><a class="header" href="#physical-self-sufficiency-sustainable-living">Physical Self-Sufficiency: Sustainable Living</a></h3>
<p>Through collaboration with one of the co-founders of Dubai Sustainable City, one of the first ever net-zero communities of its size, we will ensure that OurTown is sustainable and self-sufficient in terms of food, energy, water and waste. More than half of the land area is reserved for nature and recreational areas. These areas will contain regenerative farming and conservation zones that promote social engagement that will become a core element of the education of OurTown’s children. We are also obtaining a separate plot in the most fertile region of Zanzibar to supplement the city food supply and we are already in contact with local nature conservationists and regenerative farmers. </p>
<p>Our team is currently working on ways to sustainably manage OurTown’s water supply, energy production, waste, mobility and air quality. We aim to integrate the solutions into the built environment in innovative and harmonious ways.</p>
<h3 id="digital-self-sufficiency-digital-sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#digital-self-sufficiency-digital-sovereignty">Digital Self-Sufficiency: Digital Sovereignty</a></h3>
<p>OurTown citizens will have complete digital sovereignty through a decentralized internet infrastructure  installed in the city. This technology has already been developed and deployed by ThreeFold around the world. The network will consist of thousands of small nodes that generate compute, storage and network capacity, allowing citizens to store their data locally and to truly own it. All citizens will have secure digital twins that store their data, facilitate peer-2-peer communication and provide completely reliable identification. These twins will also provide applications for and solutions to all of its citizens' digital needs, from messaging and file storage to education, without involvement by third parties. </p>
<h3 id="governance-self-sufficiency-autonomous-governance"><a class="header" href="#governance-self-sufficiency-autonomous-governance">Governance Self-Sufficiency: Autonomous Governance</a></h3>
<p>The strong digital identity management of OurTown unlocks many possibilities around autonomous governance. OurTown will be managed by a DAO involving all its members. Due to Digital Twin technology, the community-run DAO can accept proposals for changes/grants and easily/ and securely vote on them.</p>
<h2 id="green-technology"><a class="header" href="#green-technology">Green technology</a></h2>
<p>We are in contact with innovators and businesses that will help OurTown become an example self-sufficient and carbon-neutral development. The diagram below shows what technologies are planned for use in order to make the waste, material, energy, food and water processes more regenerative. Research and development on these technologies will attract talent and provide significant know-how to people in Zanzibar working on the project. </p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/sustainableTech.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="ourtown-holding-balance"><a class="header" href="#ourtown-holding-balance">OurTown holding balance</a></h2>
<p>The development of OurTown Sustainable City represents the political will to work towards a sustainable future. Commitment to regenerative practices will result in sustainable and equitable growth which will become an example for the rest of the world. The development will showcase how sustainable development can be achieved while reflecting the values of the local communities and their culture.</p>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/sustainable_dev.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The integration of digital aspects of the development to the regenerative practices within it will make an incredible example of how emerging technologies can be used to foster sustainable development with the right policies. OurHub will make it convenient for innovators and businesses to come to the city to work on disruptive technologies. These innovators will be able to use OurTown as a physical or digital home. 
Imagine a sustainable city where the social needs of all are met while living in symbiosis with nature. Mother nature provides abundantly, but only if we treat her well. By keeping environemntal needs in mind, you are already creating a better future for your people. And when the needs of both the planet and the people are met, you open the door for successful and reliable economic development.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="location"><a class="header" href="#location">Location</a></h1>
<p><img src="ourtown/img/location.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OurTown is located in Fumba on a 1 million square meters plot. The government has prepared a master plan of the region with the plot of OurTown reserved for development includng a business center, sport centers, medical center, university and many other facilities. The plot is 15 km from the airport and 18 km from Stone Town. Fumba is expected to be a developed region of Zanzibar after planned government investments in the area. This will attract anyone wanting to own a property in Fumba and Zanzibar in general. </p>
<p>OurTown will be a catalyst in bringing together the strength of government with the entrepreneurship of the private sector. It will also foster innovation and collaboration by housing various digital businesses and talented individuals in one location within Zanzibar. As such, OurHub wll not stand on its own, and OurTown is an example in the world of how digital can be connected to physical space. With sustainability at the core of the project, OurTown sets an example for the future. Eventually millions of people can call this home while maybe physically few thousands of people will live there. OurTown is expected to attract local communities and other people around the world. There are frequent flights from the Middle East and Europe into Zanzibar. </p>

<p><img src="ourtown/img/utilization.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OurTown will contain everything that its citizens need. Majority of the land is allocated to nature and recreation areas. The citizens of OurTown will have a complete eco-living experience with designated parks, bioretenetion areas, work&amp;play environments, and themed gardens. The nature parks will showcase plants that are native to Zanzibar. These environments will be supported by technologies that aim to minimize waste to provide authentic eco-living. Residential areas will be dispersed among the nature and recreation areas to blend the buildings into the greenery. There will be various residential options for the large audience of the project ranging from digital nomads to families of the employess working within the city. </p>
<p>OurHub will attract many digital businesses to OurTown and its commercial amenities. OurTown will have a business center with office spaces and co-working environments to meet this demand. The large number of people within OurTown, whether they are residents, employees or visitors, will be able to shop from many organic and local sourced shops. Moreover, all services needed by the citizens of OurTown will be provided locally. </p>

<p>Threefold has a dedicated team working on the development. Our team is working on designs for the city and contacting innovators for planning the advanced engineering systems within the city and people that will implement these solutions. The partnerships created through this research and development process can later be products themselves within the incubation center. We are also in contact with <strong>world renowed sustainable architecture and engineering organizations</strong> that have the same values with us. These relations will help the  buildings and operations of the city become a partnership itself that will serve as means for further partnerships in Zanzibar and PR opportunity. </p>
<h2 id="experience-from-previous-sustainable-developments"><a class="header" href="#experience-from-previous-sustainable-developments">Experience from previous sustainable developments</a></h2>
<p>One of the core members of the development team is one of the co-founders and engineers of the Dubai Sustainable City, which is the first ever net zero energy community in the world of its size. It provides high standards of eco-living and a healthy lifestyle. The city in Dubai trained more than 250 engineers and technicians on how to build sustainable communities while creating more than 3000 jobs. It introduced new solutions and fostered innovation. Having the experience from the previous developments is really valuable for reaching that standard and exceeding it. Zanzibar's unique and hospitable climate will make it easier and cheaper to achieve a self-sufficient and carbon-neutral living. </p>

<p>Our beautiful world has turned into a crazy place that is changing rapidly – not all innovations are for the greater good. We are spearheading an incubator which is making real change and which has a purpose to resolve some of the biggest issues in the world. </p>
<p>There is a lot of talk in the world, we believe the time for talking is over, we need action and we need it now, our planet is a super beautiful place, we don’t want to take it for granted, we want to fight for it. </p>
<p>The Internet was a beautiful place 30 years ago, we want it back and we believe a better internet is an instrumental tool to make us free again, to allow us to all together create a better world for ourselves and our children. The internet is now owned by and benefits the few, rather than the many. We became a product in a capitalistic system – yet most of the world still holds humanistic values. It’s time to return the internet to the people. Will you join us?</p>
<p>It all started with a group of crazy people and “nerd” engineers, who decided to stop talking and just build a new system. We didn’t ask for permission, we didn’t do a crypto ICO with lots of promises, we started building. </p>
<p>With the help of more than 80 investors and thousands of project supporters we have been able to build a lot and are working on even more:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new internet infrastructure platform (fully peer2peer and decentralized, and super reliable) = ThreeFold</li>
<li>A new decentralized and regulated finance &amp; digital asset exchange system, based on values (work in progress)</li>
<li>A set of incredible experiences, with the ability to provide digital freedom for all our online requirements.</li>
<li>An upgraded economic system platform where no money needs to be paid to offer or find information, where lock-in does not exist.</li>
<li>A Digital Twin system which is the base of Banking and Web 4.0, a new way to communicate, share, collaborate</li>
<li>A decentralized healthcare &amp; education system</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 50m USD has been invested so far, we have a very active community of hundreds of contributors and we are working with some governments to deploy the system in their country. We are excited about a future where we can together create a more safe platform, based on values, transparency and love. Not in a talking way, in a super practical can do mentality with concrete plan. We are doing it, join us… become part of our movement.</p>
<h2 id="funding"><a class="header" href="#funding">Funding</a></h2>

<p>Our team launched the internet hosting and datacenter business in Europe. It's fair to say that we were at the beginning of the internet's enormous growth at that time. We hosted the largest websites in the world during this period. UEFA, Nasa, World Cup,, … Numerous times we demonstrated how to achieve super scale while staying sustainable.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-backup-data-deduplication-system-in-the-world-2005"><a class="header" href="#the-first-backup-data-deduplication-system-in-the-world-2005">The first Backup Data Deduplication system in the world (2005)</a></h4>
<p>Upto 100x benefit compared to the status quo in data centers at that point.
We showed how our customers could back up full data centers with 100x less energy and storage utilization.
This product still lives on in all Symantec backup products. This was a highly innovative solution, there was nothing like it at the time as. It facilitated the  move away from tape to disk based backup systems.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-cloud-system-in-the-world-2008"><a class="header" href="#the-first-cloud-system-in-the-world-2008">The first cloud system in the world (2008)</a></h4>
<p>We formed one of the key innovation groups in the field of cloud computing. Concepts like Virtual Private Datacenter were invented by us. We were one of the main sources of inspiration for companies like VMWare for their cloud strategy. We became the core of SUN microsystem, and the inspiration behind Sun’s ambition to become the largest player in the cloud industry. This didn’t happen inthe end because Oracle bought SUN and buried all Sun’s cloud computing projects.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-always-consistent-database-in-the-world-2010"><a class="header" href="#the-first-always-consistent-database-in-the-world-2010">The first always consistent database in the world (2010)</a></h4>
<p>This was a major technological achievement, we pioneered and developed the method to store data in a database over multiple sites in such a way that data could never be lost, corrupted or order of updates changed. Consistency was key. This database was called Arakoon and served as inspiration for further database projects. This fact is little known but is especially relevant today</p>
<h4 id="the-first-unbreakable-and-distributed-storage-system-in-the-world-2012"><a class="header" href="#the-first-unbreakable-and-distributed-storage-system-in-the-world-2012">The first unbreakable and distributed storage system in the world (2012)</a></h4>
<p>We invented a way to store petabytes of information in such a way that no-one can hack it, and the data can never be corrupted.
This system was 10x more energy efficient compared to any alternative. This led to our biggest exit to date. Even today there are barely any storage systems which can compete with our approach and solutions that were developed at that time.</p>

<p>We developed the first blockchain which was not using proof of work to battle the energy usage which went with proof of work blockchains. We have used this system for the last 4  years. Today many blockchains have evolved in this direction.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-peer2peer-cloud-in-the-world-now"><a class="header" href="#the-first-peer2peer-cloud-in-the-world-now">The first peer2peer cloud in the world (now)</a></h4>
<p>Probably our biggest achievement to date. A real carbon removing, sovereign peer2peer cloud.This system is being deployed and evolved in one of our scale out startups called ThreeFold.
The benefits of this system are huge. We had to write an operating system from scratch (re-using linux kernel), a new blockchain provisioning layer as well as the most reliable and sustainable storage system in the world. This system has now been deployed in many locations. More than 40m USD has been invested by founders and friends to make this possible.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-we-work"><a class="header" href="#how-we-work">How we work</a></h1>
<p>At OurWorld, we believe that decentralization is needed across a wide array of systems – including organizations – to build a better tomorrow. Decentralization typically brings more resilience, equality, and fairness. As such, we apply this in a variety of ways across our own structures and practices. </p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized = Online, global, uncensorable.</li>
<li>Autonomous = Self-governing.</li>
<li>Organization = Coordination &amp; collaboration around shared objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.</p>
<p>Think of them like an internet-native business that’s collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice.</p>
<p>This opens up so many new opportunities for global collaboration and coordination.</p>
<p>DAOs operate using smart contracts, which are essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met. These smart contracts establish the DAO’s rules. Those with a stake in a DAO then get voting rights and may influence how the organization operates by deciding on or creating new governance proposals.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>DAO</th><th>A traditional organization</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Usually flat, and fully democratized.</td><td>Usually hierarchical.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented.</td><td>Depending on structure, changes can be demanded from a sole party, or voting may be offered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary.</td><td>If voting is allowed, votes are tallied internally, and the outcome of voting must be handled manually.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Services offered are handled automatically in a decentralized manner (for example distribution of philanthropic funds).</td><td>Requires human handling, or centrally controlled automation, prone to manipulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>All activity is transparent and fully public.</td><td>Requires human handling, or centrally controlled automation, prone to manipulation.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. A DAO’s financial and voting transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.</p>
<p>Decentralized autonomous organizations are typified by the use of blockchain technology to provide a secure digital ledger to track financial and other community interactions across the internet, hardened against forgery by trusted timestamping and dissemination of a distributed database. This approach eliminates the need to involve a mutually acceptable trusted third party in a transaction, simplifying the transaction. </p>
<p>The costs of a blockchain-enabled transaction and of the associated data reporting may be substantially offset by the elimination of both the trusted third party and of the need for repetitive recording of contract exchanges in different records. For example, the blockchain data could, in principle and if regulatory structures permit it, replace public documents such as deeds and titles. In theory, a blockchain approach allows multiple cloud computing users to enter a loosely coupled Peer To Peer smart contract collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-dao-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-a-dao-work">How does a DAO work?</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, a DAO is an organization where decisions get made from the bottom-up; a collective of members owns the organization. There are various ways to participate in a DAO, usually through the ownership of a token.</p>
<p>DAOs operate using smart contracts, which are essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met. Smart contracts are deployed on numerous blockchains nowadays, though Ethereum was the first to use them.</p>
<p>These smart contracts establish the DAO’s rules. Those with a stake in a DAO then get voting rights and may influence how the organization operates by deciding on or creating new governance proposals.</p>
<p>This model prevents DAOs from being spammed with proposals: A proposal will only pass once the majority of stakeholders approve it. How that majority is determined varies from DAO to DAO and is specified in the smart contracts.</p>
<p>DAOs are fully autonomous and transparent. As they are built on open-source blockchains, anyone can view their code. Anyone can also audit their built-in treasuries, as the blockchain records all financial transactions.</p>
<p>Typically, a DAO launch occurs in three major steps Smart contract creation: First, a developer or group of developers must create the smart contract behind the DAO. After launch, they can only change the rules set by these contracts through the governance system. That means they must extensively test the contracts to ensure they don’t overlook important details.</p>
<p>Funding: After the smart contracts have been created, the DAO needs to determine a way to receive funding and how to enact governance. More often than not, tokens are sold to raise funds; these tokens give holders voting rights.</p>
<p>Deployment: Once everything is set up, the DAO needs to be deployed on the blockchain. From this point on, stakeholders decide on the future of the organization. The organization’s creators — those who wrote the smart contracts — no longer influence the project any more than other stakeholders.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-daos"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-daos">Why do we need DAOs?</a></h2>
<p>Being internet-native organizations, DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. One significant advantage of DAOs is the lack of trust needed between two parties. While a traditional organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it — especially on behalf of investors — with DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.</p>
<p>Trusting that code is easier to do as it’s publicly available and can be extensively tested before launch. Every action a DAO takes after being launched has to be approved by the community and is completely transparent and verifiable.</p>
<p>Such an organization has no hierarchical structure. Yet, it can still accomplish tasks and grow while being controlled by stakeholders via its native token. The lack of a hierarchy means any stakeholder can put forward an innovative idea that the entire group will consider and improve upon. Internal disputes are often easily solved through the voting system, in line with the pre-written rules in the smart contract.</p>
<p>By allowing investors to pool funds, DAOs also give them a chance to invest in early-stage startups and decentralized projects while sharing the risk or any profits that may come out of them.</p>

<p><img src="oursource/img/opensource.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Open Source is one of the main components necessary to develop healthy, equitable and safe digital solutions that can address societal challenges. Open Source enables what closed systems hinder: designing with the user, developing towards public good, rapid prototyping, the culture of sharing, transparent peer review, and unobstructed multinational collaboration. </p>
<p>Raising awareness of Open Source; strengthening the policy environment for supporting and developing Open Source solutions; engaging startup and entrepreneurship ecosystems to consider Open Source as a viable approach and business model to develop products; and discovering and developing digital public goods is a priority of OurSource for the following reasons: </p>
<h2 id="1-freedom-and-flexibility-of-open-source"><a class="header" href="#1-freedom-and-flexibility-of-open-source">1. Freedom and Flexibility of Open Source</a></h2>
<p>Freedom and flexibility are central to the values of open source software, and that is perhaps best exemplified by the accessibility of the software.  Most open source projects can be pulled from public repositories and used immediately.</p>
<p>Why is that important to businesses? By removing barriers to developer tools and building blocks, developers can begin the work of enhancing your systems immediately without waiting on procurement or license barriers. Furthermore, access to the source code allows developers to enable themselves quickly, reducing the learning curve to being effective with the technology. </p>
<h2 id="2-high-quality-open-software-by-design"><a class="header" href="#2-high-quality-open-software-by-design">2. High Quality Open Software by Design</a></h2>
<p>Open source software code will be seen and critiqued by a community of people. Developers are more apt to write better code knowing other experts are going to be looking at their code and reviewing it.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental pillars of open source software development is the express and shared goal of creating excellent software. By implementing software review and community acceptance, shared communities inspire excellence in development. If you know that your peers will be looking at your code publicly, you’re likely to do your best work. </p>
<p>Why is that important to your organization? Businesses already gain an organizational cost-benefit by not having to start creating code by scratch. We call that “standing on the shoulders of giants.”  In order for that statement to carry any meaning, it’s critical that organizations can trust the quality of the code coming out of the community. Ultimately, starting with high quality components gives you a higher chance of having a custom build at a quicker speed – saving you time and money.</p>
<h2 id="3-exponentially-lower-costs-with-open-source"><a class="header" href="#3-exponentially-lower-costs-with-open-source">3. Exponentially Lower Costs with Open Source</a></h2>
<p>The most commonly mentioned benefit of open source software is cost savings. Typically, open source software implies that you are not obligated to pay for the use of software. You don’t need to use procurement overhead to manage license renewals.</p>
<p>It is highly beneficial to enterprises to save budget on software to utilize elsewhere. While this story of completely free software is changing for some products, with many communities utilizing closed and open components, for the most part open source software remains free. </p>
<h2 id="4-open-source-security-through-transparency"><a class="header" href="#4-open-source-security-through-transparency">4. Open Source Security Through Transparency</a></h2>
<p>Open source software security is a concern for many organizations, and something largely addressed by the “many eyes” theory of open source. The term, coined by Linus Torvald, is that if all of the source code for a project is made open there will be more opportunities for white hat professionals to review that code and make it more secure. This theory has continuously proved itself to be true.</p>
<p>Consider the Linux operating system. This operating system is considered to be one of the most secure software products in the world and its completely open source! Businesses are rightfully continuously concerned with the security of their infrastructure and data – by design open source is a lot more secure than you may assume. </p>
<h2 id="5-oss-communities-enabling-innovation"><a class="header" href="#5-oss-communities-enabling-innovation">5. OSS Communities Enabling Innovation</a></h2>
<p>When you have a product that someone is working on because they want to work on it, (not just because they’re getting paid) their personal drive to add creativity and contribute their best ideas tends to be a lot higher. This is often what inspires enthusiast open source communities to develop features that are new and disruptive, and why we see open source projects leading the way in terms of this disruption.</p>
<p>Why is this important to organizations? The pace of digital transformation has moved faster than anyone predicted. In the coming decade, the companies that cannot keep up with innovation will quickly become outdated. All organizations should be focused on modernizing and digitizing their products and assets, and that includes a proactive and energetic strategy for the consumption and management of open source software.</p>

<p>Digital transformation used to be something that’s just good to have. But since COVID-19 disrupted business operations worldwide, many organizations now see digital transformation as a necessary step in preserving their business as reflected by the most current digital transformation statistics. Fueled by speedy internet everywhere, digitization now plays a critical role in adding business value.</p>
<p><img src="company/market/img/fintech_market_size.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The global Fintech industry is growing at an exponential rate: </p>
<ul>
<li>The global fintech market is estimated to be worth $131.95 billion</li>
<li>The fintech space is set to surpass $400 billion by 2027</li>
<li>The fintech market is growing at a CAGR of 25.18%</li>
<li>Over 26,000 fintech startups were launched last year</li>
<li>In total, an estimated $8.49 trillion of digital payments will be made in 2022</li>
<li>The global digital banking market size was valued at $8 trillion in 2020 and is growing at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2027</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="company/market/img/fintech_market_growth.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>By 2026, this fintech industry is projected to grow to $324 billion at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.18%. </p>
<p>There are several key factors behind the continued rapid growth within the fintech space. Advancing automation tech and an ever-growing array of online and app-based services are perhaps the most important factor driving fintech’s growth. Improved accessibility and reduced costs mean fintech solutions are more readily available to would-be consumers.</p>
<p>In addition, lenient regulations in the space and changing consumer demands/expectations have further boosted the market.</p>
<p><img src="company/market/img/digital_banking_market.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The E-Bank (Neo/Challenger Bank) market size was valued at USD 28.73 Billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 627.99 Billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 47.17% from 2021 to 2028.1</p>
<p>An estimated $8.49 trillion of digital payments will be processed globally during the course of this year. Increasing at a CAGR of 12.31% until 2027.</p>

<p>10,900,000 Digital Nomads from the US in 2020.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Emergent Research and MBO Partners have collaborated on an extensive digital nomad study. We found that the number of Americans describing themselves as digital nomads rose from 7.3 million in 2019 to 10.9 million in 2020 — an increase of 49%. And the composition of this cohort shifted. In previous years, the ranks of digital nomads were dominated by independent workers: freelancers, independent contractors, and the self-employed. But the 2020 nomad surge was driven by people with traditional jobs. Untethered from their offices, many employees decided to take to the road. In fact, the number of digital nomads with traditional jobs rose from 3.2 million in 2019 to 6.3 million in 2020 — a 96% increase. Traditional job holders now make up a majority of those pursuing this nontraditional work lifestyle.</p>

<p>State of the art rendering and experiences beyond e-commerce and marketing. A metaverse built by and for the people using it, with worthwhile capabilities that enhance your virtual experience. </p>
<p>A high quality metaverse experience cannot be delivered from far away datacenter, just like a very high resolution and action intense games cannot be delivered by central large datacenters.  Local gaming consoles are top of the market and present the best gaming experience to gamers. Gaming consoles are local to gamers for optimum performance and experience. For immersive metaverse high quality and responsive metaverse experiences you need local data compute and storage and GPU rendering.</p>
<h3 id="local-gpu-rendering"><a class="header" href="#local-gpu-rendering">Local GPU Rendering</a></h3>
<p>OurVerse’s proximity by ThreeFold’s edge computing allows rendering proximity (low latency) and speed unmatched in the industry.</p>
<p>This allows streaming and graphic rendering at super high speeds with pixel perfect imagery, making OurVerse the first metaverse to achieve this status.</p>
<p>Even on mobile devices, GPU rendering shows quality previously not available for such experiences.</p>
<h2 id="metaverse-is-making-remote-local"><a class="header" href="#metaverse-is-making-remote-local">Metaverse is making remote local</a></h2>
<p>The metaverse allows to create physical world experiences and in general things we are used to available in the digital space.  We do so much in our personal and professional lifes online that is replaces a lot of physcial times being with others.  In order to make that digital online life more like our day to day physical life.  Email, Todo lists, video conferences they can all be redone and redesigned into somthing that is more personal and provides everyone with more detailed input and feedback about the situation we are in.</p>

<h3 id="personal-todo-list"><a class="header" href="#personal-todo-list">Personal ToDo list</a></h3>
<p>The metaverse presents real work experiences in a new an innovative way.  For example a wall with ToDo list functionality will present different personal ToDo lists for any that is looking at the same wall. Also, when two people want to share their todo lists they can make their private todo list viewable for other digital avatars in the digital space.

<p>Covid-19 has put digital meetings in everyones agenda.  From business meetings to school classes, we all have been using industry standard video conferencing tools.  This is a step forward from having audio conferences only, but a lot can be improved if all participants are part of and in a virtual space where everyone has 3D virtual representation and experiences the same (virtual) environment as one would in the real world in a conference room.</p>
<p>This is make possible in the metaverse and proximity of the virtual world rendering makes the experiences high quality and latency free.

<ul>
<li>
<p>All data stays in country</p>

<li>
<p>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML), this identity needs to be unique on country scale and usable for all digital services of the government as well as private sector if they would like to.</p>

<p>All critical data is stored on a quantum safe storage system with the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data should never be lost.</li>
<li>Data should never be corrupted.</li>
<li>The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption.</li>
<li>All history should stay intact and data should not be modified.</li>
<li>Security should go beyond encryption technology as it is NOT enough. Security needs to be quantum safe.</li>
<li>The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and be scaleable to at least 1000 petabytes in order to be ready for the future.</li>
<li>Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) desired.</li>
<li>Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact, uncorrupted and online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be flexible, which means usable for all required digital services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be truly decentralized</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-owned by the private sector and government institutions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Delivered by local teams operating within the country (living &amp; working)</li>
<li>Guided by a non corruptible entity (not for profit might be a good idea) as a supervising entity.</li>
<li>All source code must be open (open source)</li>
<li>Enough technically skilled people in the country to work &amp; understand this code.</li>
<li>The code must have limitless usability and there can't be hidden costs (licenses, …) </li>
<li>The country must be able to improve and develop the country from within its borders.</li>

<p>Without going into detail national cyber security is becoming a major topic of the future. See what happened with Ukraine, the first Russian attack eliminated their core digital backbone and datacenters.</p>
<p>We believe the government needs to get a sovereign system where only open source components are used, which are understood by technical teams with a deep level of expertise on those components.</p>
<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple operating systems.</li>
<li>Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, ie <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm">EMP</a>-safe.</li>
<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if the entry points get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe.</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (they need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>
</ul>
<p>This system can be integrated in the sovereign and public internet, or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable <a href="techsolutions/solution_cyberpandemic.html">PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE</a>.</p>

<p>The internet is not optimized, most data should stay local but it actually travels very far away.</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/internet_distance.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<h2 id="status-quo"><a class="header" href="#status-quo">Status Quo</a></h2>
<p>When two individuals in Zanzibar want to communicate, for example over a zoom call, their transmitted data must follow an incredibly lengthy and expensive journey; </p>
<ul>
<li>the message must travel to the central Zanzibar internet exchange</li>
<li>it then crosses in one of two sea cables to mainland Tanzania</li>
<li>the message undergoes a very long journey to a European or American internet exchange</li>
<li>in Europe, the message is routed to Zoom's datacentre where it is processed.</li>
<li>Finally, the message is sent back along the entire route to the second person</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This situation is not sustainable!</strong></p>
<p>There are five primary issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data must travel over such a long distance, increasing transmission times and increasing the energy consumption of the infrastructure along the route.</li>
<li>Crucial bandwidth with the rest of the world is used up, meaning that critical communication is delayed for unreasonably long periods of time. </li>
<li>Data is not owned by Zanzibar or its people; it is owned by multinational corporations in the West.</li>
<li>If those two undersea cables digitally connecting Zanzibar to the rest of the world were ever damaged, the entire internet within Zanzibar would fail as well. Two residents would no longer be able to communicate with each other over the internet.</li>
<li>Transmitted data is far less secure and has a far greater attack surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="threefold-alternative"><a class="header" href="#threefold-alternative">Threefold Alternative</a></h2>
<p>We present an alternative solution in which data remains within zanzibar and we avoid all of the issues above. The journey will be massively simplified; the first individual interacts with their twin to send a message to the second individual's twin, where it is immediately accessible.</p>

<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/today_internet.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>The internet today is constructed in a centralized way, we exist many times and became a product of big centralized corporations. There is also a real cyber pandemic going on; there are cyber attacks everywhere and backdoors in most of the electronic equipment we use. This architecture is unsafe, not scalable, power hungry and unable to deliver equality. Still, more than half of our planet does not have decent affordable access to the internet.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is a huge step in the right direction but it's a shared architecture distributed over the world where data gets replicated in many locations. It is a good technology choice for use-cases like money, smart contracts, voting, digital notary services and identity management but not at all suited for building a new internet. This is also called web4. Developers still need to develop applications connecting to multiple blockchains and centralization is often not good enough.</p>

<p>To create an upgraded abundance-based internet system we need to provide following three pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold</li>
<li>an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) </li>
<li>a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance-based world</li>

<p>Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch; an internet which would deliver all the needs for a better future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.</p>
<p>In each OurWorld Internet, abundance is the foundation:</p>
<ul>

<p>This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-integrated-defi"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-integrated-defi">The Internet of Internets integrated DEFI.</a></h2>
<p>Each Regional Internet hosts and connects to its own set of blockchains and web4 and banking4 functions, which interact with global public blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, Casper Labs, Cosmos, Stellar, Algorand and all the rest...</p>
<p>Each Regional Internet is responsible for their</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity &amp; reputation management of the members of their community.</li>
<li>DEFI blockchain with links to any other possible blockchain as required.</li>
<li>DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization </li>
</ul>
<p>Each Regional Internet hosts a capable decentralized financial system (DEFI) which operates on multiple levels:</p>
<p>This Ourworld DEFI system is unique because it allows the integration of any other local or global blockchain token in such a way that the token is usable from within the OurWorld Instance even if for whatever reason connection with the global network would be broken. As an additional benefit, using the external token with OurWorld would go faster and would not need the extreme energy needed for tokens like Bitcoin (today 100USD worth of energy per transaction).</p>
<p>The DEFI system is also the liquidity pool and treasury (initial funding) for each OurWorld Internet.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-reliable"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-reliable">The Internet of Internets is Reliable</a></h2>
<p>Each Regional Internet is ultra reliable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data can never be lost nor corrupted.</li>
<li>Internet lines can be cut, even if all public Internet connections would go down, the local instance would still function, allowing financial transactions to happen and information to be consulted as the data is local and safe.</li>
<li>The distributed nature of the Internet of Internets is even war-safe, a disaster or war situation has no impact on the reliability of the internet (if a large enough distribution is achieved)</li>
<li>All systems are local and sovereign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because it's an effort by the people for the people it has, by design, more support and so it can grow without limits.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-opensource"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-opensource">The Internet of Internets is OpenSource</a></h2>
<p>All components inside the system are open source and all of the code and knowledge required is delivered as part of the local deployment. As a result, every community can contribute to and co-create our future.</p>
<p>It's a platform created by all of us for everyone. There is a 100% decentralized code management system integrated to allow this to happen.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-of-internets-is-complete"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-of-internets-is-complete">The Internet of Internets is Complete</a></h2>

<li>Sikana (education system with lots of content, +4billion views today)</li>
<li>Uhuru (alternative to Office 365 or Google Docs/Drive)</li>
<li>Alternative to twitter, whatsapp, facebook, … </li>
<li>The resources and materials needed to deploy such an internet (manuals, ebooks and videos)</li>
<li>Full set of information
<ul>
<li>We are executing on a huge effort to download and categorize +40 Petabytes of information from the existing internet, this information will be available in each OurWorld Instance. We will make sure that all this information is protected and available to everyone in the world independent of what is happening or what will happen.</li>
<li>It's an endless stream of information (maps, educational content, source code, knowledge, ebooks, …).</li>

<p>On the security side, the Internet is super centralized today and actually very vulnerable. The Cyber Pandemic is a reality.</p>

<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/web_remade_architecture.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>We are brainwashed about the need to centralize and control everything. As such, we produce suboptimal systems and a lot of waste. Web 1,2 are all centralized by nature. The best the world has been able to come up with is a shared consensus driven architecture called blockchain which is good for certain use cases but suboptimal for many more. </p>
<p>The solution is actually very simple, you should be the center of your digital life, you own all your data; you are your own application (we call this your digital twin), we believe +90% of your digital needs can be implemented that way. Blockchain technology is needed for items where consensus is required like identity, money, smart contracts…</p>
<p><img src="abundance_internet/architecture/img/twin_infrastructure.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>There is a need for a co-owned global Internet infrastructure on top of which each of us can exist digitally, this is a dramatically different architecture with no centralization whatsoever and offering 100% equality as well as full data and application ownership. This has never been done because it's so different in design and is incompatible with big money-making corporations maintaining control.</p>
<p>The twins live on top of the ThreeFold Grid which is a co-owned infrastructure layer where every Internet Farmer makes money by providing storage, compute and network capacity to the people around them.</p>
<p>The twins communicate with each other and the rest of the world (existing centralized services) as well as existing blockchain technologies. The twin data uses a novel storage technology which makes sure your data is safe and can never get lost, yet it's only owned by you and not even a quantum computer can hack it.</p>

<p>Countries have a hard time defending themselves against cyber security threats; the main issue is that the technology available to them often comes from compromised sources. Where better to put backdoors than in the tools which should defend you? As such, we now have an IT infrastructure which is rife with issues and which is incredibly difficult to make secure.</p>

<h3 id="data-privacy--sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#data-privacy--sovereignty">Data Privacy &amp; Sovereignty</a></h3>
<p>Almost all data of a country's internet users is not hosted on that country's soil. This leads to a loss of sovereignity and poses serious data risks to the citizens of your country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who’s ever cleared a browser history feels like technology throws us back at ourselves. My Google data, combined with my bank card transactions, social media messages, health records, and more, could tell you more about me than I could. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Most of us don’t have the time or energy to keep track of all the data we’re shedding online, or read all the terms and conditions when downloading an app. (Ten years ago, two researchers at Carnegie Mellon found it would take the average internet user 25 days per year to read every privacy policy on every website they visited. Today, that number will only have increased) We are now in a position where we have to trust that regulators and industry leaders are keeping us safe.</em></p>
<p><em>But policy makers are struggling to keep up with the pace of technological advances. The number of devices collecting and analyzing information in real time, otherwise known as the internet of things, is expected to exceed 50 billion by 2020.</em></p>
<p><em>Recent, high-profile data breaches, such as Uber’s loss of 57 million users’ information, and political firm Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of Facebook data relating to nearly 90 million users, show even when we think we’re being careful online, we’re not always safe from harm.</em></p>
<h3 id="for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative"><a class="header" href="#for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative">For Most Countries The Internet is GDP Negative</a></h3>
<p>Internet DATA is more important than voice (minutes) these days, the main communication of the future is through data, new regulations and technical guidelines are required to secure this future trend.</p>
<p>Most of the revenue related to internet and telecommunications services does not stay in your country and as such the internet is GDP negative. We believe that by means of practical technology and regulatory guidelines, this trend can be reversed. The value of a digital life in the US is thousands of USD per year per person; imagine the potential for your country.</p>

<p>Too few individuals control access to the internet, leading to unjust pricing and security risks. It's too easy for hackers to focus on the few parties delivering access to the rest of us. More decentralization will lead to more security and fairer chances for everyone involved. Ledger (blockchain) technology can be used to decentralize internet access yet still give full insight to the country's government in relation to billing &amp; utilization statistics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CBDC = Central Bank Digital Currencies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CBDC’s are an incredibly exciting possible innovation for a country. But, we realize that there are serious challenges and requirements not met in relation to sovereignty, security, and scalability in many of the current project proposals.</p>
<p>This is not only for CBDC’s, but blockchain technology in general.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that this does not happen for your country. We want to make sure your country maintains control over your money supply. Right now, in some deployments, we see that this is a real risk and countries could lose control to other countries or hackers.</p>
<p>Buying into a technology from a vendor which does not apply to following requirements is discouraged</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of the blockchain needs to be in the country (nodes, technology, knowledge, …)</li>
<li>The source code of the blockchain technology needs to be understood by engineers and developers living and working in your country and working for a trusted entity (or more than one)</li>
<li>The blockchain technology needs to be truly decentralized
<ul>
<li>e.g. the coders should not be able to change the blockchain operation (right now most tech companies can change their blockchains by changing the code)</li>
<li>The validator nodes cannot be hosted in datacenters out of the country or be owned by too few parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It needs to be verified that there are no backdoors in the blockchain technology.</li>
<li>Blockchain needs to be scalable enough</li>
<li>Even if internet backbone connections go down (e.g. between the country and the rest of the world), the blockchain should keep on working.</li>
<li>Blockchain should be energy efficient and not based on burning fossil fuels or, more generally, high energy consumption.</li>
<li>There need to be procedures to allow the legal system of your country to interfere in case serious issues arise.</li>
<li>There needs to be a mechanism for people to manage their identity and private keys with more user friendliness (today it's too complicated and too dangerous).</li>
<li>Running blockchain permissioned (which means managed by people in centralized datacenters) might bring the risk of running a money chain related to a couple of people who need to be trusted, this might even be less regulated than in a typical central banking environment.</li>

<p><strong>This multi-trillion USD problem</strong> will not go away by itself. we have a multitude of technology solutions at our disposal which are able to provide a real antidote for the cyberpandemic. This antidote is not a &quot;layered on&quot; painkiller quick fix, but a from-the-ground-up re-engineered, effective and breakthrough solution.</p>
<h3 id="some-possibilities"><a class="header" href="#some-possibilities">Some possibilities:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A liquid cooled, edge distributed, decentralized network of small datacenter nodes (they can be in basements or other hidden locations). Through decentralization, we can achieve the redundacy necessary to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. </li>
<li>Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. This is also an ultra scalable system.</li>
<li>A country-owned multilayer network communication encryption system for the government and other collaborators.</li>
<li>Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox the access and hosting of these apps.</li>
<li>Use blockchain technology (BUT within the country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, which do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or controlled too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for CBDCs.</li>
<li>Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).</li>
</ul>
<p>### The more expensive solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in the harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). This secondary network would be compatible with 4G devices, where only authorized people can gain access, End2End encrypted and not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints mean extreme resilience to all attacks and disasters.</li>
<li>Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut into chunks of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.</li>
<li>A communication mechanism which does not use TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA-based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams within the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have are less probable and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. This is expensive though but, in our opinion, worth it. This fulfils the crucial need for sovereignty.</li>
<li>All critical software used should be owned by local experts within the country and it all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to minimise backdoors and to keep things simple and integrated.</li>
<li>Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.</li>
<li>All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly should occur within the country.</li>

<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple operating systems.</li>

<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if the entry points get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe.</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (they need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>

<p>ThreeFold tech stack has 4 main layers</p>
<ul>
<li>compute - a flexible way to deploy any workload on edge cloud computers</li>
<li>storage - a quantum safe storage system</li>
<li>network - a planetary scalable overlay network</li>
<li>blockchain for Smart Contract For IT</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="technology/img/tech_overview2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A lot of capacity has been deployed in the world, ThreeFold farmers buy a computer and they connect it to the internet, as such they use our Operating system to provide Internet capacity to the world.</p>
<p><img src="technology/img/3node_simple.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are multiple ways how people can interactive without our platform (as developer or IT expert = sysadmin):</p>
<p><img src="technology/img/architecture_usage.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>All technology is developed by ThreeFold and is opensource, this technology is being used for the ThreeFold grid see https://www.threefold.io which is a deployment of a new internet which is green, safe and owned by all of us.</p>
<p>This document explains how we are a missing layer for the full web2, web3 and blockchain world.</p>
<p>This leads to a system which is highly scalable.</p>

<p>We believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planet First</strong></li>
<li><strong>People Second</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profit As Result</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.</p>
<p>Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.</p>
<p>We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Together we are a movement, not just a project or company. Together we are creating the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>abundance based</li>
<li>unlimited knowledge</li>
<li>glocal communication and collaboration</li>
<li>exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&quot;When you were born in a world where you don’t fit in, you were born to help create a new one.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Internet of Internets is owned by the people.</li>
<li>It interconnects us all, directly, without anyone in the middle.</li>
<li>We store our data in full sovereignty and privacy.</li>
<li>On top of it, we build valuable experiences, useful experiences.</li>
<li>Not to control. Not to addict. Not to manipulate.</li>
<li>Rather to connect. To exchange. To share. To provide value for each other.</li>
<li>A circular economy, to benefit the collective and, as a result, each of us individually.</li>
<li>As believers in a better world who choose to act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>&quot;The fight for a better Internet is inseparable from the fight for a better world.&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p>We can continue down the path we’re on.<br />
But ask yourself, is it a good one? Is it the right one? Is it just?<br />
Is the world we live in today the one we wish for our children and all those to come?</p>
<p>If yes, please continue.<br />
If not, we have an answer.</p>
<p>Come on, come all. Creators. Builders. Dreamers. No need to dream anymore.</p>
<p>This is the Internet of Internets.<br />
It’s for you. For me. For all of us.<br />
By you. By me. By all of us.</p>
<p>So, are you with us? Then come along.<br />
Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets.</p>

<p>Create the infrastructure layer for an upgraded internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more reliable internet, one which can meet the challenges of the future 
(climate change issues, possibility of unrest, financial crisis, …). </li>
<li>A more sustainable internet, using a lot less energy</li>
<li>A more safe internet</li>
<li>An internet where we can be the center of our digital life with more security, less costs, no middleman, …</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing for</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiences which allow people to be free, safe and self sovereign.</li>
<li>Any application which puts the people in the center and allows them to have full control over their data &amp; future.</li>
<li>New financial systems (DEFI, but different than today's casino-like environment, peer2peer)</li>
<li>Projects which want to build communities to achieve planet positive goals.</li>
<li>Countries that choose to work in a decentralized manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course all of this can only happen by building communities and by collaborating with like minded projects/people.</p>
<h2 id="why-an-upgraded-internet"><a class="header" href="#why-an-upgraded-internet">Why an upgraded Internet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The current internet is very unstable (too centralized fiber cables, data centers, …)</li>
<li>The current internet is very unsafe</li>
<li>The current internet is not distributed enough, only in a few countries.</li>
<li>The current internet is too power hungry.</li>
<li>The current internet is too complicated</li>
<li>The current internet is exploitative, it turned us all into a product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-create-an-upgraded-abundance-based-system-we-need-to-provide-following-3-pillars"><a class="header" href="#to-create-an-upgraded-abundance-based-system-we-need-to-provide-following-3-pillars">To create an upgraded abundance based system we need to provide following 3 pillars:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold</li>
<li>an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) </li>
<li>a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance based world</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch, an internet which would deliver all the needs for a different future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In each Regional Internet abundance is the base:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of free information, education, knowledge (books, encyclopedias), earth information (maps, videos), art (music, video, …), …</li>
<li>Your applications required for your digital professional and personal life are all free</li>
<li>You can find anything for free, you can promote everything for free.</li>
<li>You can freely exchange anything to anything else (money for good, good for good, money for money, …)</li>
</ul>
<p>This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.</p>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/waterfall.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets, is not one Internet as owned by the very few. It is thousands of interconnected Internets, where each Internet is founded and grown by a local community. YOU become Troadmaphe Internet.</p>
<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets is our chance to create a beautiful digital world in which we are free and powerful, a world where we can co-create a better future for everyone. We need to say NO to being a product of the large centralized corporations. We need to free ourselves, even from our own brainwashing.</p>
<p>We need a system where we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be free and independent yet fully interconnected over all OurWorld Internet of Internets</li>
<li>Learn and play, grow in awareness and learn from each other</li>
<li>Don’t have to be afraid of an uncertain future where the privileged few define the next steps</li>
<li>Don’t become addicted to the biggest potential drug called money (money is not bad, money can be beautiful, money should be an energy source for change)</li>
<li>Protect the beautiful planet we live on</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The deployment of this internet can be delivered by local communities, commercial partners or government provided initiatives.</p>

<p>Many countries don’t have an internet, they have a long cable to the Internet, this leads to loss in money, data, security, and human resources. It's our aim to support countries in building their Internet and provide economic chances to the ones who have a difficult time catching up in this hectic world.</p>
<p>Key Words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sovereignty</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Cost</li>
</ul>
<p>Today most countries lose money because of the Internet, e.g. their citizens using services outside of their country, having to pay a lot for expensive Internet backbone (fiber) services, monetization of citizens data, …</p>
<p>Together with our friends we are talking to some countries who are very open about the possibilities of a sovereign country cloud.</p>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/globe.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>There are thousands of wonderful projects out there which want to provide value for the world but they miss a framework which helps them in achieving their goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>”The industry is talented in creating solutions to problems that should have never been there.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Much of the current Cloud &amp; Blockchain Industry is way too complicated and fragmented for what they need. </p>
<p>To build something today you need 10+ different systems and integrate them all. Many believe that an ecosystem of different solutions can be stitched together to create something bigger. History has already shown that this is not the case. We call this the ‘Onion Problem’ (more about this in a document I still have to write), but basically it means that systems get so complicated that people don’t dare to change anything inside so everyone keeps on creating other layers on top of the layers which already exist. This leads to even more complicated systems which no-one seems to fully understand and allowing hackers to have a great time because there are hundreds of places to find vulnerabilities in. Blockchain did not make things easier, it became even more difficult and non transparent.</p>
<p>It's difficult for projects to build a system which allows them to scale and work easily with their communities. The systems today are simply too complicated and unsafe (think about current wallets, exchanges, …).</p>
<p>The current way how the internet is created is just wrong, client - server is simply wrong, the fact that we exist 100 times on the internet is wrong, we need Web 4.0. We should not spend any time on anything which is not to the benefit of our Vision and The Planet.</p>
<p>Projects need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trust based system, where people can be themselves and communicate with each other and the project in a safe container with full identity and transparency.</li>
<li>A financial (funding &amp; exchange) system which is safe, fast, reliable and easy to use for everyone.</li>
<li>An application and development platform which allows them to build their &quot;experience&quot; in the fastest possible way with less complexity and no need to re-invent everything (like is the case now).</li>
<li>A storage system where all data &amp; information is stored by the user and owned by the user. An ultra reliable system which can never lose data and which scales to a planetary scale.</li>
<li>An easy system so that less technical people can also use it.</li>
<li>A system which is cost effective, we know projects who went bankrupt by doing good because they could not afford existing centralized cloud systems.</li>
<li>A system which keeps the data in the country where the people live, this leads to more performance and safety.</li>

<p><img src="ourworld_ecosystem/img/internet_sea_cable.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>ThreeFold is a decentralized, sovereign and sustainable internet infrastructure platform with +US$ 50m invested and about 100 people working full time on the project. ThreeFold is driven by their mission to empower 1 billion people with sustainable access to a self-sovereign Internet by 2030. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THREEFOLD IS ONE OF THE MAIN PROMOTORS OF OURTOWN AND OURWORLD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ThreeFold solves two serious problems present in the legacy stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost of expanding Internet infrastructure:</strong> Large-scale, centralized data centers cost billions to build. The Internet needs to triple its infrastructure size this decade to support emerging data requirements. With an upcoming global economic downturn, an alternative is needed urgently. Threefold flips the current model upside down, incentivizes anyone with electricity and network to connect computers from their home or office to expand the Internet and earn monthly revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loss of digital sovereignty and net-neutrality:</strong> 20 companies own the Internet’s infrastructure today. This threatens our sovereignty and net neutrality and is a major concern for countries worldwide that have already started to cut the Internet into pieces e.g. great firewall of China. ThreeFold’s secure serverless infrastructure provides a peer-to-peer Internet model that solves most of the sovereignty and security concerns present in today’s infrastructure stack.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="threefold-benefits-to-ourworld-znz"><a class="header" href="#threefold-benefits-to-ourworld-znz">ThreeFold benefits to OurWorld ZNZ</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All data remains within the country</li>
<li>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML). This identity needs to be unique on a country scale and usable for all digital services of the government as well as private sector if they would like to</li>
<li>All critical data (billing, identity, records, etc) are stored on a quantum safe storage system which means</li>
<li>Data can never be lost</li>
<li>Data can never be corrupted</li>
<li>The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption</li>
<li>All history stays intact, data cannot be modified</li>
<li>Encryption technology is NOT enough for security, because it is not quantum safe</li>
<li>The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and needs to be able to scale to at least 1000 petabyte to be ready for the future</li>
<li>Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) required</li>
<li>Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact, uncorrupted and online.</li>

<p><img src="company/licenses/finance/img/psp.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>OurWorld Company aims to provide Payment Service Provider (PSP) licences to businesses and merchants. A payment service provider (PSP) is a company which provides merchants with individual merchant accounts, helps them with merchant underwriting and payment processing but does not fund merchants directly. </p>
<p>PSP is a necessity in the digital age, offering online shopping services through electronic payments by using methods like direct debit, credit card, online bank transfer etc. while acting as a mediator between banks and customers. In simple words, it is an online payment solution for multiple channels, including mobile and online store.</p>
<p>Currently, E-Commerce is booming around the world, and people are opting for online shopping and paying online as well. 
PSPs are critical for any financial ecosystem and country as they provide their residents and customers with the support for their multiple payment methods and currencies.</p>
<h2 id="psp-architecture"><a class="header" href="#psp-architecture">PSP architecture</a></h2>
<p><img src="company/licenses/finance/img/psp3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Payment gateways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work as direct customer intercommunication</li>
<li>Connect different systems, such as card processing platforms and point of sale (POS) systems</li>
<li>Provide the connectivity for retailers to access their payment processors</li>
<li>Allow configuring the appropriate gateways in various ways for both in-store and online businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in the background to facilitate the interaction of payment gateways</li>
<li>Transfer financial data between merchant accounts and gateways</li>
<li>Ensure all transactions are processed properly, efficiently, and quickly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-a-psp-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-a-psp-work">How does a PSP work?</a></h2>
<p><img src="company/licenses/finance/img/psp_how.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Each time a customer enters their card details and clicks ‘pay’, a transaction request is sent to the OurWorld Company payment gateway (blockchain based).</li>
<li>The PSP blockchain then verifies that the customer’s card or digital wallet holds the required funds to make the payment. The PSP does this with the help of a payment processor in case of FIAT.</li>
<li>Once the customer’s card or digital wallet details are verified, the PSP either confirms or declines the payment according to the funds available. If confirmed, the PSP initiates the transfer of funds from the customer’s account to the associated merchant account.</li>
<li>Finally, the PSP sends a transaction notification to the customer and the merchant to confirm the payment's completion.</li>
<li>In the case of a declined transaction due to invalid card details or insufficient funds, the PSP will terminate the transaction and send a status message notifying the customer and the merchant of the failed payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a PSP ensures secure and efficient transfer of funds between customers and merchants. That being said, there are other benefits that PSPs offer business owners in addition to facilitating payments. Signing up with a PSP offers several advantages, from transaction reporting, to the ability to accept multiple payment methods in multiple currencies.</p>
<h2 id="additional-advantages-of-using-a-psp-under-ourworld-company"><a class="header" href="#additional-advantages-of-using-a-psp-under-ourworld-company">Additional advantages of using a PSP under OurWorld Company</a></h2>
<h3 id="accept-multiple-payment-methods"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-payment-methods">Accept multiple payment methods:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide support for several payment methods through a single channel, ensuring your customers can conveniently choose from a variety of options. This level of accessibility supports customer satisfaction. Integrating different payment methods such as online banking, credit cards, debit cards, and e-wallets to your business can incur costs, but signing up with a PSP makes the whole process hastle-free. There are only two types of fees you need to pay: a one-time set-up fee, and a small monthly fee for enabling payments.</p>
<h3 id="make-transactions-securely"><a class="header" href="#make-transactions-securely">Make transactions securely:</a></h3>
<p>All information sent through a transaction request is controlled by the PSP. This information is heavily encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring only the customer can view their banking or financial information. This provides customers a better sense of security, and encourages them to go through with the payment.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-fraud"><a class="header" href="#prevent-fraud">Prevent fraud:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs only initiate transfers of funds once the customer’s card details and funds availability are verified. This prevents merchants and business to be compromised by fraudulent transactions.</p>
<h3 id="accept-multiple-currencies"><a class="header" href="#accept-multiple-currencies">Accept multiple currencies:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide support for multiple currencies to enable fast and secure cross-border payments. This is important for business planning to expand their presence abroad. </p>
<p>OurWorld Company has access to a third-party processor with +17 global currencies integrated with VISA, Mastercard and UnionPay. By integrating them to our platform, we aim to streamline international PSP services from day 1. </p>
<h3 id="get-monthly-reports-on-payments"><a class="header" href="#get-monthly-reports-on-payments">Get monthly reports on payments:</a></h3>
<p>Most PSPs offer monthly reporting features for business payments and transactions. Through automation, PSPsS can provide real-time reporting features (accounts payable, reconciliation, expense management, tax reports etc..) at an affordable cost.</p>
<h3 id="add-new-payment-methods-easily"><a class="header" href="#add-new-payment-methods-easily">Add new payment methods easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs allow people and businesses to expand their payment methods seamlessly. New payment options are being created regularly to simplify customers and merchants experiences. Leading PSPs integrate these new options fast to remain up-to-date with the latest payment methods, automatically making them available to you.</p>
<h3 id="opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks"><a class="header" href="#opening-accounts-with-acquiring-banks">Opening accounts with acquiring banks:</a></h3>
<p>Before accepting card payments, a business has to set up a merchant account with an acquiring bank. PSPs can support businesses by fast tracking their applicationss with the acquiring banks. PSPs can also have pre-existing accounts with acquiring banks, allowing businesses to get sub-accounts under the pre-existing PSP accounts. This makes the whole process of setting up a merchant's account much easier, as these accounts are already approved and functioning.</p>
<h3 id="reconcile-transactions-easily"><a class="header" href="#reconcile-transactions-easily">Reconcile transactions easily:</a></h3>
<p>PSPs provide complete transaction reports for all of your payment methods. This makes it easier for you to reconcile transactions in the future.</p>

<p>A custodian is a financial institution that holds customers' securities for safekeeping to prevent them from being stolen or lost. The custodian may hold stocks, bonds, or other assets in electronic or physical form on behalf of its customers.</p>
<p>Often, a custodian does more than provide asset protection. It can manage customers' accounts and transactions, manage the settlement of financial transactions, account for the status of assets, and ensure compliance with tax regulations.</p>
<p>It safeguards assets and is not engaged in &quot;traditional&quot; commercial or consumer/retail banking like lending. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific for OurWorld Company, our digital custodian services are digital only and 99% automated, they do not giving banking powers to the operator nor do they allow the operator to provide financial investment services.

<p>In the current internet system I exist many times, each application provider owns my data and provides functionality they own and let me use in return for my data.</p>
<p>We are digitally sovereign:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am me, I am sovereign</li>
<li>I have an identity, I only exist once</li>
<li>What I learn and experience is mine </li>
<li>I do not exist for the benefit of others </li>
<li>I have my own digital skills and capabilities, these are owned by me</li>
<li>Everything I produce is owned by me, and stored by my twin on locations my twin and me know about.</li>
<li>Because the capabilities are owned by me, they can easily be extended and I can use them everywhere, it makes my life easier, I don't have to learn different tools each time I enter another event</li>
<li>I am capable of making my own decisions</li>

<p>Every person owns a Digital Twin, which is your personal Internet Gateway Application. This Digital Twin (also called Freeflow Twin) is running on a location of your choice. Each twin is owned by only one owner. The Twin has lots of capabilities and serves its owner 24h a day, 7/7. Experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin.</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/intro_twin_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A twin owns your data and your identity. All data is stored in such a way it can never be corrupted or lost. You own your data, your identity and your digital skills for all your life.</p>
<p>And when you die you can handover your digital heritage to your beloved ones.</p>
<p>Each Twin has following capabilities:</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/capabilities_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Twins are unique, they talk directlty to each other, no centralized datacenters or server farms needed.</p>

<p>Lets make a comparison of how our digital systems work in relation to how we do things in day to day life, in this case we are comparing with an educational event.</p>
<p>We hope you will see how current web experiences are and not logical, they are designed to lock us in ,and treat us like their product rather than being only at our service.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-2-way--the-current-internet"><a class="header" href="#the-web-2-way--the-current-internet">The Web 2 way = the current internet.</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to an educational event, it is very affordable, maybe even free</li>
<li>They ask me to change clothes and use theirs, so we all look alike</li>
<li>I am not allowed to bring or use my own tools. They give me theirs, a pen, headset, glasses, and a notebook, which I am asked to return at the end</li>
<li>The event creators keep my freedom limited and overwhelm me with audio/video experience, if I am allowed to chose, it is all based on their scripts</li>
<li>They drive me around from activity to activity in the experience, its all very well done and impressive</li>
<li>They track everything I do, to make sure they can adjust the experience to have me even more impressed next time, because they want me to come back</li>
<li>If I take notes it is in their notebook, but I can't take it with me, if they destroy it its gone</li>
<li>I am happy, because it's all incredible and very well done</li>
<li>I take the commercial content for granted because yeh, you know I got this for a low cost, they need to make money too</li>
<li>If I want to get back to the content of the event, I need to pay again and go through the event again</li>
<li>If I would go to another (similar) event from another provider, I would have to restart from scratch, I would have to get other tools, another notebook, I cannot reuse what I have produced on the first event.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the good thing is, I don't have to think that much and it is very addictive, they learn very well what we like and keep on improving constantly, so we want to come back.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-3-way"><a class="header" href="#the-web-3-way">The Web 3 way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All as above, but the event is not owned by a company but by all of us</li>
<li>We have a vote in how the event should be created</li>
<li>It is at least better because if, working properly, it iss a consensus owned experience</li>
<li>Now at least we have the feeling we co-own how the event is being created</li>
<li>We will realize its all very hard to run a real democracy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-freeflow-way"><a class="header" href="#the-freeflow-way">The FreeFlow Way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to the education event</li>
<li>They check if the tools I have are up-to-date for the experience they have created. If not they tell me where I can get new tools (upgrade them), but they remain mine. These tools are my core digital capabilities or skills,</li>
<li>I can now go into the event and experience 'the experience' as prepared for me, I walk freely around, I take notes on my notebook, so I can use it later,</li>
<li>I have a lot of freedom where to go, and what to do first,</li>
<li>I can use many more of my capabilities, I don't have to learn new ways to do something, because the tools (capabilities) are mine. I can dance, sing, run, jump, ...</li>
<li>I will be able to do things the creators of the event did not foresee, there is so much joy and freedom, I am creative and I am alive,</li>
<li>Its easier to make friends, because I can bring my friends in a much easier way, because they already have the required capabilities,</li>
<li>I can give authenticity to the experience, my feedback matters from out of my own power,</li>
<li>It might be I have to think and act more myself, I am using my tools (capabilities) in the incredible experience as created by the education event organizers,</li>
<li>I will be super happy because I feel empowered, I am less addicted maybe because I am less controlled, but I know whatever I learned is for me to keep, I feel productive because I am allowed to use my capabilities, and my data was enriched by me..</li>
</ul>

<p>PS: This event can be single owned or co-owned (like in web3).</p>

<p>Doesn't this sound like a better idea, don't we wanna have a tool which works that way?</p>

<p>We all exist many times, for each application we exist, it actually is very messy and leads to manipulation and also complexity. Its not convenient having to use 3 different messaging apps.

<p>Private version of the chat:</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/skills/extra/img/chat_overview.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The chat communication tools presents a simple interface to manage both individuals and group messaging. The interface presented is very similar to mainstream messaging platforms but works in a very different way.</p>
<p>Centralized messaging services always have a third party (company) involved.  A message would follow the following path:</p>
<h2 id="chat-architecture"><a class="header" href="#chat-architecture">Chat Architecture</a></h2>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    subgraph Individual A;
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALA --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA;

    MESSAGINGA(messaging platform);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    subgraph Individual B;
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB;
    end;
</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the messaging provider sits in the middle and has access to all messages passing through its messaging platform. It means that messaging providers can (or can be told to) do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do machine learning on message content and/or message volume, frequency, size and all sort of other data</li>
<li>expose, compile and sell machine learning outcome (metadata)</li>
<li>provide access to meta data or actual messaging information to other companies or governing bodies</li>
<li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous documentaries and news stories out there that prove that this is the case. A decentralized messaging platform avoids all of this.</p>
<p>Decentralized messaging send and receive messages from private messaging instances to the receiving party's private (messaging) instance. It doesn't have a central man in the middle. There are two main types of decentralized messaging in this capability:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>private chat</em>: private entity to private entity</li>
<li><em>group chat</em>: one private entity creates and <strong>hosts</strong> the &quot;group&quot;, and all the other members are invited to post and receive message from this group. The entity that starts the group also sets the groups &quot;rules&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-chat"><a class="header" href="#private-chat">Private Chat</a></h3>
<p>With private chat we mean a chat between two entities. These entities could be individuals, organizations, companies, clubs, basically anything.  The chat is a one to one chat, and information (data) is exchanged between two private, secure and personal messaging platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>a chat starts with inviting the other persons twin (messaging and other services platform ), in this case the twin of the other person needs to be found and sent an invite message.</li>
<li>if the person accepts the invite, a secure connection allows messages to be send person to person without a third party in the middle. Only the (twins of) two people involved have access to he message data (metadata).</li>
</ul>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR

    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| TWINA

    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|Browser| TWINB
    TWINB --&gt;|secure network| TWINA
    end
</pre>
<p>The chat functionality allows most (if not all) of the standard functionalities known from many centralized platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>send text message</li>
<li>send voice message</li>
<li>message reply</li>
<li>message forward</li>
<li>send photo/file/</li>
</ul>
<p>From the chat function you can also initiate video conference, and have control over accepting, deleting and blocking users.</p>
<h3 id="group-chat"><a class="header" href="#group-chat">Group Chat</a></h3>
<p>Group chat is unique to this peer2peer chat platform. The group functionality is initiated by the group creator and this action creates the group function on the initiators' messaging platform (twin). The group is then formed by inviting other entities and when they accept they get 'read and write' access in the group messaging functionality.</p>

<h2 id="communication-tool-video"><a class="header" href="#communication-tool-video">Communication tool: Video</a></h2>
<p>A truly peer2peer video chat experience starting from your digital twin to your guests', without stopping by a data center in between. Of course, free.</p>
<p>Current world video conferencing services use service provider and centralized software installations to present services to businesses and consumers. Take for example two users in Zanzibar who wish to communicate through zoom (or google meet, or Microsoft Teams, principle stays the same), they will connect from their laptops/phones to a centralized service, and the traffic will be routed from both of their devices to a centralized service datacenter far away.</p>
<p>In principle this looks like</p>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    
    subgraph Individual A
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A)
    end
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA
    subgraph Video service provider
    MESSAGINGA(Video service platform)
    end
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA
    subgraph Individual B
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB
    end
</pre>
<p>And if we expand this to a world map it would look somethingg like this:</p>
<!--
mermaid source in: ./includes/centralized_video.md

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><img src="mytwin/skills/extra/img/videoconference_central_1.png" alt="" />)</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: pictures are too small, need to make new ones, also revisit text &amp; flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not lead to create the best experience, and overall it is very wasteful with a number of (scarce) resources.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to have a video conference solution that works peer2peer.</p>

<p>If we build a video conferencing system that follows this principle we can be much more effective.  Back to the example earlier, the two people in Zanzibar would be able to communicate as follows:</p>

<p>Browsing the internet present risks. There are many sites which have malicious codes embedded in what look like harmless web pages.

<p>Lacking the tools to enable effective and sustainable
collaboration and sharing between children, teachers and the school.</p>
<p>Traditional marketplaces use money to measure the exchange of values and resources. However, money cannot be used as recognition for the children’s contributions in the school.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying our gratitude points as recognition for their contributions and positive exchanges enabled a remarkable impact and flow of values.
Children, teachers and parents support each other, their school and staff resulting in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift from passive listeners to mutual learning through peer-to-peer teaching</li>
<li>Kids extend their real life capabilities by practicing new skills</li>
<li>Kids are significantly more engaged and happy</li>

<p><strong>Enterprises to NGOs</strong></p>
<p>Large businesses are storing unimaginable excess inventory of goods.</p>
<p>Goods that were returned by customers, didn’t sell during the season or simply finished their use even though they are still in great condition.</p>
<p>Those resources are stuck, expensive to store, or dumped and no one benefits from it.</p>
<p>Flow of enterprises’ excess capacity becomes an income for NGOs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive the valuable goods (in-kind donations)</li>
<li>Upload the goods to the Social Delivery (“SD”) marketplace</li>
<li>Distribute points to the approved NGOs as a monthly budget</li>
<li>NGOs shop in the SD marketplace for things they really need at the time needed NGOs 1. exchange their points for chosen merchandises and equipment</li>
<li>NGOs distribute these items to the communities they support</li>
<li>NGOs saves significant amount of money</li>
<li>Saved money enable the NGOs to better deliver on their core mission</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tax credits for “in-kind donations” motivate enterprises to further participate and benefit for doing good out of zero value inventory that cost them money to store or eliminate.</em></p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying Floweavers resulted in a win-win-situation both for the enterprises and the NGOs. The capacities and inventories that were stuck at the enterprises were donated and uploaded to the market place and became very useful for the NGOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating NGOs received a monthly budget of $2,156 - $10,385 in points</li>
<li>With this budget of points the NGOs could order online items that they needed</li>
<li>NGOs were enabled to also offer help (and not just get donations)</li>
<li>Keep their fiat money to better fulfill their core mission</li>
<li>Businesses linked their in-kind donations towards their corporate responsibility.</li>

<p>Use case of a Peer2Peer community shipping:</p>
<p>Betty needed to pick up an item from a member, on the way back home she delivered an item to another member who lives near her, and gained additional points for it. The way it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betty is scheduled to meet Lee to pick up an item</li>
<li>Lee asked Betty if she can also take another item for someone that lives next to her</li>
<li>Betty agreed and picked up two items: one for herself, one for another member -Rachel</li>
<li>Rachel contacted Betty to schedule a pickup time to get the item</li>
<li>Rachel rewarded Betty with points for delivering the item closer to her home.</li>

<p>State of the art rendering and experiences beyond e-commerce and marketing. A metaverse built by and for the people using it, with worthwhile capabilities that enhance your virtual experience. </p>
<p>A high quality metaverse experience cannot be delivered from far away datacenter, just like a very high resolution and action intense games cannot be delivered by central large datacenters.  Local gaming consoles are top of the market and present the best gaming experience to gamers. Gaming consoles are local to gamers for optimum performance and experience. For immersive metaverse high quality and responsive metaverse experiences you need local data compute and storage and GPU rendering.</p>
<h3 id="local-gpu-rendering-1"><a class="header" href="#local-gpu-rendering-1">Local GPU Rendering</a></h3>
<p>OurVerse’s proximity by ThreeFold’s edge computing allows rendering proximity (low latency) and speed unmatched in the industry.</p>
<p>This allows streaming and graphic rendering at super high speeds with pixel perfect imagery, making OurVerse the first metaverse to achieve this status.</p>
<p>Even on mobile devices, GPU rendering shows quality previously not available for such experiences.</p>
<h2 id="metaverse-is-making-remote-local-1"><a class="header" href="#metaverse-is-making-remote-local-1">Metaverse is making remote local</a></h2>
<p>The metaverse allows to create physical world experiences and in general things we are used to available in the digital space.  We do so much in our personal and professional lifes online that is replaces a lot of physcial times being with others.  In order to make that digital online life more like our day to day physical life.  Email, Todo lists, video conferences they can all be redone and redesigned into somthing that is more personal and provides everyone with more detailed input and feedback about the situation we are in.</p>

<h3 id="personal-todo-list-1"><a class="header" href="#personal-todo-list-1">Personal ToDo list</a></h3>
<p>The metaverse presents real work experiences in a new an innovative way.  For example a wall with ToDo list functionality will present different personal ToDo lists for any that is looking at the same wall. Also, when two people want to share their todo lists they can make their private todo list viewable for other digital avatars in the digital space.

<p>Covid-19 has put digital meetings in everyones agenda.  From business meetings to school classes, we all have been using industry standard video conferencing tools.  This is a step forward from having audio conferences only, but a lot can be improved if all participants are part of and in a virtual space where everyone has 3D virtual representation and experiences the same (virtual) environment as one would in the real world in a conference room.</p>
<p>This is make possible in the metaverse and proximity of the virtual world rendering makes the experiences high quality and latency free.

<p>Education is a sector that still relies on traditional teaching methods, a teacher, a classroom, a black (or white) board, books, paper and pencils. This method has been in use for hundreds of years. In the current digital age, the classroom can be a digital classroom, with a teacher teaching while all of the rest of the required items can be digitised.</p>
<p>Traditional learning is based on a live teacher, teaching an audience in a classroom. This works, however it has a number of restrictions which makes that work for a limited number of pupils, and not everywhere, because of the necessity to have live teachers and pupils. In this digital world we can record and present the learning materials in a digital manner to a much larger audience than a single classroom.  Classes, or better as curriculum can be digitised and shared along a much larger group of pupils spanning a vast geographic area.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has proven that remote teaching is possible and that the current technology allow for this. This experience was still based on the standard teacher - pupil relationship and numbers for live teaching. Another technology, a video sharing platform has proven that storing videos and sharing videos is a effective manner to reach a very large number of viewers (youtube.com).</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/experiences/sikana/img/sikana2_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Taking the learnings from both of these current use cases, we have created Sikana. Improve your life - one skill at a time. Sikana is a free education platform, with more than 4 billion views, aiming to deliver quality education and necessary skills to everyone. The software can be installed on threefold nodes and deployed regionally so that bandwidth requirements are minimised because it is a decentralized online education platform.</p>

<p>To scale such a solution for many classrooms in many schools and in many different regions put enormous requirements and stress on the central video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Decentralized video sharing as an education platform will lower the requirements on the education / video sharing platform and creates, stores and distributes educational content from within a region, or even from within a school. This brings a solution to educate everywhere, even if there is no internet connection. A simple Wifi router that connects devices to the educational platform is all that is needed.</p>

<p><img src="tfgrid/theinternet/img/theinternet.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet is the global system of interconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer networks</a> that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">Internet protocol suite</a> (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. </p>
<p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, cabling or radio links, repeaters, modems etc. An Internet Protocol address (IP address), a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, enables us to the Internet Protocol for communication and store/run data on the infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, e-mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony (calls), file sharing, and streaming media services.</p>
<p>Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in centralized data centers owned by a few large corporations. This centralized model is inefficient, as through it's centralized model, if the main servers go down, the whole system experiences downtime. Hundreds of downtime events have been recorded throughout the last few years. Also, given these companies own the data centers, they also own the data that is contained in them and use it for profit reasons. </p>

<p>More than 500 undersea cables and thousands more terrestrial networks connect us all together digitally. These cables carry our data between server and recipient. While satellites also play a role in connectivity, without cables it's safe to say the global Internet would not be what it is today.</p>

<h1 id="the-internet-data-centers"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-data-centers">The Internet Data Centers</a></h1>
<p>Today the Internet is mainly delivered out of data centers, which are huge facilities containing up to millions of servers. They centralize shared IT operations and equipment for the purposes of storing, processing, and disseminating data and applications. Data centers have become a foundational necessity of today's Internet, but there are several significant issues with them:</p>
<h2 id="centralization"><a class="header" href="#centralization">Centralization</a></h2>
<p>The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute and storage (and network) infrastructures. Also, this global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China. This means that most of today's Internet is out of reach of billions of people in developing nations particularly in South America, Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<h2 id="cost"><a class="header" href="#cost">Cost</a></h2>
<p>It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyperscale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients. To meet the projected growth of the Internet in 2022, $5 trillion would have to be invested with this model.</p>
<h2 id="energy-consumption"><a class="header" href="#energy-consumption">Energy Consumption</a></h2>
<p>Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage an around 205 TWh of energy - more than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.</p>
<h2 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<p>The current IT stack depends on human infallibility and as such, human error has been considered the primary cause of 95% of cybersecurity breaches. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information.</p>
<h2 id="cannot-support-future-demand"><a class="header" href="#cannot-support-future-demand">Cannot Support Future Demand</a></h2>
<p>To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will need to be built and will consume an additional 400 GW/h. This is roughly equivalent to Japan’s energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.</p>

<h2 id="the-internet-needs-to-be-local"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-needs-to-be-local">The Internet Needs To Be Local</a></h2>
<p><img src="tfgrid/theinternet/img/internet_bandwidth.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet today is constructed in a centralized way. The hyperscale data centers that form the backbone of the Internet's infrastructure play a massive role in our digital lives, and they are often located far from users, particularly those living in developing countries or regions. Each time we take an online action such as posting a photo or sending a message, the data is transmitted from our device to that centralized data center, and to the person or persons on the other end. So, you can begin to see how proximity to these servers plays a role in the end user experience.</p>
<p>Internet bandwidth refers to the amount of information or data that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for speed, but they are not the same. Whereas bandwidth is how much information you receive in a given time, speed is how fast that information is received.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of filling a swimming pool with water. If the hose has a wide circumference, more water can flow than if the hose were narrow. In this instance, water is the bandwidth and the rate at which the water flows is the speed.</p>
<p>There are many factors that go into both bandwidth and speed. An end-to-end network path usually consists of multiple connections, each with different bandwidth capacity. And the link with the lowest bandwidth can limit the overall capacity of all connections in the path. When data travels shorter distances, this is less of a factor. Network congestion (usage) is also a major factor. And it's pretty clear to see how by traveling long distances, this would become a bigger problem.</p>
