# Tier S Circular

The Tier S Circular approach allows to build the most reliable and redundant datacenters in the world.

A larger datacenter typically 2-10 mwatt capacity is extended with at least 9 edge datacenters.

Each edge datacenter is on a ring and can be 3 to 30 pods.

The main datacenters can be pod, rack based on container based.
