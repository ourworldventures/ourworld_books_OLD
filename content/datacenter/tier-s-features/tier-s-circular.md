# Tier S Circular

> S stands for Self Healing, we made them compatible with Tier 3 and Tier 4.

Tier-S datacenters are compatible with Tier 3 and most of Tier 4 but they have additional benefits:



## Principles

- The Tier S Circular approach allows to build the most reliable and redundant datacenters in the world.
- A larger datacenter typically 2-10 mwatt capacity is extended with at least 9 edge datacenters.
- Each edge datacenter is on a ring and can be 3 to 30 pods.
- The main datacenters can be pod, rack based on container based.

## More Info

- [Tier-S Container](tier-s-container.md)
- [Tier-S Pod](tier-s-pod.md)
- [Tier-S Storage](tier-s-quantum-safe-storage.md)
- [Tier-S Racks](tier-s-racks.md)
- [Tier-S Audit Flow](tier-s-audit-flow.md)

## Benefits

### reliability

### redundancy

- all is liquid cooled (submerged)
- liquid cooling is a much more simple process how to cool.

### war proof

- the circular design 

### self healing
