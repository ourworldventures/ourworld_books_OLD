# A BRAVE NEW DIGITAL TANZANIA IMAGINED !!!

Tanzania can be one of the first mover of a digital revolution where everyone becomes the center of their digital life.

**This would bring incredible benefits:**

1. National education would improve
1. National health would improve
1. Leadership would be recognised for its vision and execution capability
1. Digital residents would be proud & delighted to be part of a beautiful Tanzania ready for the future
1. National GDP would go up
1. Security would increase

Rather than implementing all as a painkiller approach (see [here](no_pain_killer.md)), why not go to the root and build a new digital backbone which is done in such a way it resolves the majority of requirements for a country's digital transformation.

## Imagine if the Tanzania government can

* Ensure that every relevant party and all assets are documented & authenticated in one national digital system:
    * People: Identity for each Digital Resident (peer reviewed, with KYC/AML integration if needed)
    * Land: Land Registry available to everyone where no-one can alter the information if they are not following the right processes and verification steps. Integrated with ultra reliable augmented reality and GPS systems
    * Companies: Universal company registration with all relevant information available in a unified way. Data super well protected and only modifiable with well-defined processes.
    * Products: Records of every container coming in & out of the country with contents, purpose, and parties involved, …
* Allow every Digital Resident (company or person) to send money to each other in the most transparent way (needs help from mainland):
    * Free of charge for non commercial transactions
    * Supports offline transactions where either one or zero parties involved are connected to the internet
    * **Can even function where there is no (or limited) electricity!**
* Have insight on every <span style="text-decoration:underline;">commercial</span> transaction which occurs in Tanzania:
    * Parties involved in the transaction (at least one needs to be commercial)
    * Purpose of the transaction
    * Specific information for example in a harbour; tax, sales of goods, ...
* Allow  companies in the country to save 10-30% on operational costs
    * No need to pay to companies like airbnb, bookings.com, tripadvisor, ...
    * No need for marketing on platforms like google, facebook, ... 
    * Integration & Automation: no need for complicated accounting systems, integrated tax reporting, ...
    * Hotels: help them get insight about their sales, which waiter does what, … 
* Have all transactions and other relevant information logged in a system which cannot be corrupted:
    * Information is stored on a quantum safe archive system with blockchain capabilities
    * Date can never be lost, corrupted or changed; a perfect audit trail for the future
    * Unlimitedly scalable
* Be at the forefront of the digital revolution and be recognized for it on a global scale.



## What if Tanzania is one of the first to make this happen?

**Our Goals:**

* Implement a single sign-on digital authentication system usable for all of a country's digital use cases (like a digital passport) and following standards set by international organizations like the World Bank, African Union, … 
* Implement a land bank system which covers the full nation and is updated by Digital Residents, but protected and audited by satellite and a super accurate GPS system
* Implement a super efficient TAX system where everyone participates with maximum transparency and minimum cost
* Implement Complementary Digital Currencies which Digital Residents can use for their daily needs
* Implement an education system where every Digital Resident can participate as a teacher and/or a student
* Implement a digital health system which can unlock primary health care for everyone at a much lower cost using means already made available by Digital Residents (knowledge, herbs, best practices, generic medicine, …)
* Implement a new digital backbone (internet system) to support all the above with total sovereignty and security

**All of this is not only possible, we have a plan for it and we can be the first ones in the world to pull it off.**

## Let's do it together

We have ideas on how this can be implemented at the lowest possible cost with maximum benefit for Tanzania.

The basic requirements:

* All the knowledge stays in the country, incredible opportunities to grow
* All required technology (software) in the country is open source, unlimitedly usable and managed by teams in Digital, ready for the future
* All super transparent and done by Digital, for Digital
