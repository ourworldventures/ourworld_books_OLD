# Painkillers are not a solution.

Currently, most countries develop their digital future by implementing many independent projects which all act as painkillers to their problems. While a painkiller might fix symptoms, it rarely solves the root issue.

We believe your country has the opportunity to leapfrog straight to a solution which is both easier to implement and solves most of its issues all at once.

This has huge benefits:

* It's much more cost effective
* It's easier and more integrated which results in many benefits for the users
* It will be safer (think about the cyber pandemic happening right now)
* It is more prepared for the future
* It's greener (such a system will use up to 100 times less energy)
