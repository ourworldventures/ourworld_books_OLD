The Internet is now the second largest economy in the world after the financial sector. However, most countries do not have their own sovereign solution. The whole industry is being outsourced to large tech companies and this is resulting into a huge GDP loss to the emerging world. 

## The Solution

By building a decentralized Internet backbone infrastructure locally, Tanzania can support it's economic growth and further it's position as a leader in shaping the fintech vision of the region. 

The Internet backbone is poised to digitally transform the country, bringing significant developments for citizens, companies and the government itself. 

Data is now the most valuable asset in the world, and Tanzania can own it's data. According to statistics, every Internet user is worth about USD 10,000. Imagine the value the Internet backbone would attract just by hosting the data locally. 

The future is digital, and the development of the country's fintech sector is more than just a strategy, it is a necessity to attract talent, knowledge and resources to Tanzania.
