## Critical Operations Network 

![](img/reliable_net.png)  

Imagine a Network where data, storage and compute are all decentralized and distributed over the nature, combined with a standard called TETRA. This has the potential to create a reliable unbreakbale infrastructure which runs in parallel to the existing digital backbone. Even if the digital backbone system would go down, the system will stay operational.

In centralized systems, vendors will try to make the central controller redundant but this is not good enough, a full decentralized architecture is so much more powerful.


#### TETRA Systems benefits

TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) has been developed by industry experts alongside the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and has emerged as the unchallenged standard for the most demanding and professional users of radio communications worldwide.

TETRA technology brings new outstanding features to mobile communications by combining the features of mobile phones with fast data communications and the work group capabilities of PMR. Key services differentiating TETRA from other wireless technologies include:

Individual simplex and duplex calls, group calls, pre-emptive emergency and priority calls, dynamic group number assignment, call authentication, late entry, voice encryption, packet data services.
Full interoperability (IOP) with all TETRA terminals allow to freely choose and combine any of your favourite terminal brands.
